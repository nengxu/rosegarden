# Rosegarden parameters describing the ranges and preferred notation
# defaults for a variety of real world instruments
#
#
# "transposition" is sounding transposition expressed in semitone steps
#
# lowest A - highest A = amateur range
# lowest P - highest P = professional range
#
# c1 = C4
#
# Notes inside lowest A - highest A display in black
# Notes inside lowest P - lowest A, and highest A - highest P display in yellow
# Notes outside lowest P - highest P display in red
#
# When no lowest P or highest P for an instrument (e.g. piano) the value is 0
# When both ranges are unspecifiable the value is "nil"

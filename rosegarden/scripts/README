Miscellaneous scripts in this directory:

to configure from CVS with particular options

working correctly I think

exited JACK processes

convert-feta-xpm.sh, make-xpm-transparent.pl - parts of the process of
creating pixmaps from Lilypond feta fonts, used for the feta-pixmaps
notation font -- of limited use

to a Rosegarden device description file (.rgd) -- output is likely to
need some massaging

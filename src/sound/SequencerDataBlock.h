/**
 * This class contains recorded data that is being passed from sequencer
 * threads (RosegardenSequencer::processRecordedMidi()) to GUI threads
 * (RosegardenMainWindow::processRecordedEvents()).  It is an important
 * link in the chain from AlsaDriver::getMappedEventList() to
 * RosegardenDocument::insertRecordedMidi().
 *
 * This class needs to be reviewed for thread safety.  See the comments
 * in addRecordedEvents().
 *
 * This used to be mapped into a shared memory
 * backed file, which had to be of fixed size and layout.  The design
 * reflects that history, though nowadays it is a simple singleton
 * class.
 *
 * Examples of some of the shared memory related design decisions:
 * Position is represented as two ints (m_positionSec and m_positionNsec)
 * rather than a RealTime, as the RealTime default ctor
 * initialises the space & so can't be used from the GUI's
 * placement-new ctor (which has no write access and doesn't want
 * it anyway).  Likewise we use char[] instead of MappedEvents
 * for m_visualEvent and m_recordBuffer.
 *
 * Since shared memory is no longer used,
 * it should be possible to change this from being a fixed-layout
 * C-style struct to something more "C++" (e.g. std::vector<MappedEvent>
 * instead of char[sizeof(MappedEvent*CAPACITY_MAX)], RealTime instead of
 * ints, etc...).  We would need to investigate each of the users to make
 * sure things like placement new were replaced with conventional new.
 * From a maintenance standpoint, this should improve the code significantly.

/**
 *   The global structure of this exporter (MusicXmlExporter::write()) is
 *
 *   o   Write MusicXML header. This header is written by writeHeader().
 *
 *   o   Scan all tracks. During this scan an MusicXmlExportHelper is created
 *       for each track or trackgroup which will be exported. Any
 *       MusicXmlExportHelper results in a single MusicXML part. Tracks maybe
 *       grouped by the staff export options to form a multi staff part.
 *       Tracks are grouped into one single MusicXmlExportHelper if:
 *         - Consecutive track are "grouped" by curly brackets,
 *         - Tracks are assigned to the same instrument.
 *         - The setting "mxmlmultistave" is not "none"
 *
 *       Every MusicXmlExportHelper also contains a list of segments belonging
 *       the track(s) which are part of the MusicXmlExportHelper. These
 *       segments are grouped into voices (layers). Any voice consists of non
 *       overlapping segments. It is assumed the segments of the first
 *       voice/layers of each staff are joining. When there is a gap between
 *       two successive a new temporary segments is created. This segment
 *       contains rests.
 *
 *   o   Next the parts itself are written. This exporter supports both
 *       part-wise and time-wise. The structure is
 *         - part-wise:
 *               header/identification
 *               part-list
 *               part 1
 *                   measure 1
 *                   measure 2
 *                      .
 *                      .
 *               part 2
 *                   measure 1
 *                   measure 2
 *                      .
 *                      .
 *
 *         - time-wise:
 *               header/identification
 *               part-list
 *               measure 1
 *                   part 1
 *                   part 2
 *                      .
 *                      .
 *               measure 2
 *                   part 1
 *                   part 2
 *                      .
 *                      .
 *
 *       To write the measures, write() will iterate over all parts and bars
 *       for a part-wise file (or over all bars and parts for a time-wise file)
 *       and calls the MusicXmlExportHelper member writeEvents().
 *       The member iterates over all voices of the part and handles all events
 *       of the segments.
 *
 *       Some known problems:
 *       1)     When exporting multi staff part, problems arise when segments
 *              at the same time will have different transpositions. It is
 *              assumed all tracks/segments will have the same transpostion.
 *              However, this is not checked!

/*
 * ClefKeyContext.h
 *
 * This file defines a class which maintains the clef and key context
 * of a set of segments currently displayed in the notation editor.
 *
 * This context is used to see the redundant clef/key and make them invisible.
 *
 * Such invisibility can't be an event property as it may depend of other staff
 * currently edited on the same track (ie the same clef/key event may be
 * visible in a notation editor and simultaneously may be invisible in another
 * one depending of segments opened in each editor).
 */

// !!! Currently, clefs and keys lists used by notation editor are maintained
// in three different places:
//     - 1) In NotationStaff (m_clefChanges and m_keyChanges)
//     - 2) In StaffHeader (m_clefOverlaps and m_keyOverlaps)
//     - 3) Here (referenced from NotationScene::m_clefKeyContext)
// It may worth to merge these three lists and the related methods inside
// one object only.

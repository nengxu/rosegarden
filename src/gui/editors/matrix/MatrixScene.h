/**
 * Specialised graphics scene for matrix elements.  The note blocks and
 * horizontal and vertical grid lines are all represented by graphics items
 * owned by this scene.  This scene also owns the MatrixViewSegment classes
 * which track segment contents in view objects.
 *
 * The scene works with MatrixViewSegment, MatrixViewElement, MatrixPainter,
 * and MatrixMover to support the new "concert pitch matrix" concept.  All
 * pitches on the grid as well as the key signature pitch highlights are
 * represented in concert pitch, presenting the pitches as they would look if
 * they were struck as notes on a conventional piano.  If the user draws a Bb in
 * a segment in -9 (Eb) transposition, the actual event is created with a pitch
 * +9 higher, and the resulting MatrixElement representing that pitch is then
 * drawn -9, so that it remains at the correct height.  If this note were viewed
 * in notation, it would appear to be a G.
 *
 * The scene can display events from any number of segments spanning any number
 * of tracks, and the concert pitch matrix is necessary in order to avoid the
 * chaos that would ensue when working with segments in different transpositions
 * on the same grid.  Note, however, the pitch highlights may come out
 * incorrectly if the key signatures in various segments do not resolve to the
 * same key after factoring the various segment transpositions into account.
 * This kind of situation would be flagged as an error in the notation view, via
 * the track/staff header warning icon, and it is not a problem that can be
 * resolved.  In this case, the user must intervene to ensure sanity of the
 * results.

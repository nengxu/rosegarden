 * This widget is managed by RosegardenMainWindow, which receives signals
 * primarily from SequenceManager and passes them through into here, calling
 * set___Warning(true) as appropriate, and adding a new warning message to our
 * queue.
 *
 * Adding a message to the queue causes the warning button to show itself, and
 * when clicked, the queued warning messages are displayed in a tabbed dialog.

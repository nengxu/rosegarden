The files in this directory are short and simple regression test files.  When
adding new regression tests to this directory, please document their purpose in
this file.

We should probably endeavor to run through all of these before making a release.


export_hidden_key_signatures.rg
-------------------------------
I discovered that I introduced a bug in revision 8693 whereby my attempt at
preventing hidden key signatures from exporting actually broke the spelling of
exported LilyPond notes in a painful way.  This file should export with all
leter notes having -is suffixes (fis, cis, dis, gis) in the key of E major, with
only one key signature printed.

This directory contains the source for the instrument definition presets.

I am maintaining it in plain text "conf file" format for ease of
editing.  If you make changes to the file, you must generate a new
presets.xml by running

  ./regenerate-presets

The default presets-editable.conf contains U.S. English definitions.
To translate it, copy it to presets-editable-<lang>.conf (for example
presets-editable-fr.conf or presets-editable-zh_CN.conf), edit it
appropriately, and run ./regenerate-presets to generate your new
translated XML file.  This should then be installed by the standard
scons install process, and picked up automatically by Rosegarden.
Please send your translated .conf file to us at the rosegarden-devel
mailing list.

Rosegarden-4 v1.2
=================

Rosegarden-4 is a MIDI and audio sequencer and musical notation editor.

Please keep an eye on the FAQ for known problems and workarounds:

  http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/resources/faq/

When you find bugs, first check whether a newer version of Rosegarden
has been released yet; if not, please continue on to:

  http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/bug-guidelines.html


Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE 3.1, or later, or more specifically the KDE 3.1+
development libraries (you don't need the whole KDE environment).

Our code compiles with gcc-3.x.  If you are a package maintainer, and your
distro has moved to gcc-4.x, please read the note below.

For MIDI support on Linux, you need ALSA 0.9.x or 1.0; for audio you
need JACK 0.77 or newer; for synth plugins you need DSSI 0.9.x or newer.

We have recently switched from automake/autoconf/make to scons for
building.  Please see the section on Compiling from Source below for
details.


SPECIAL NOTES FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS
-------------------------------------

DSSI

Many distros released their packages of 1.0 compiled without the optional
DSSI/synth plugin support.  We received a lot of complaints on our lists from
your users and ours about your packages being built without this feature.  We
would like to request that you please take whatever steps are necessary within
the framework of your particular distro to pick up DSSI (at least the API,
although we would like to see the plugins made available too), package it, and
build Rosegarden against it.  Thank you.  For details on DSSI, see:

  http://dssi.sourceforge.net/

gcc-4.x

Several users have reported problems compiling with gcc-4.x, and we have not
had time to investigate these problems.  We are interested in patches to
smooth over various compiler incompatibility issues, but we should warn you
that several complicated patches which aimed to suppress an assortment of
deprecation and signed/unsigned int/float warnings have had to be rejected
because they either broke our compatibility with KDE 3.1, or they broke our
code.  Please do not waste your time trying to suppress these warnings, and
instead concentrate on doing the bare minimum necessary to get the code to
build.  Thank you.


Compiling from source
---------------------

You will need to obtain and install scons.  If you are not familiar with
scons, see:

  http://scons.sourceforge.net/

For a typical end-user installation with no unusual requirements, simply run

  scons configure
  scons
  scons install

Our new build system should automatically detect your installation prefix and
various optional installed libraries with no further effort on your part.  For
specical requirements, a few options are supported.  These take the format
scons configure option=[0|1], for example

  scons configure debug=1

To see a list of available options, use

  scons configure --help

To perform the equivalent of a "make clean" or "make distclean" use

  scons -c

To uninstall, use

  scons -c install

NOTE: The installation prefix should be the same as the one of your
KDE installation. However you can install to another directory, but
then you'll have to append it to your KDEDIRS variable. For instance :

KDEDIRS=/usr:/home/glaurent/rosegarden


Running Rosegarden
------------------

Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation, and also in the gui/ directory of the source
tree).  The sequencer process is started automatically when the gui is
started, provided it has been correctly installed (by "make install")
in the global KDE directories.  If you have any problems running the
application, consult the FAQ:

  http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/resources/faq/

or if that doesn't answer your question then use the rosegarden-user
mailing list on Sourceforge.

You can also "make uninstall" if you decide it's a waste of your time.


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new parts of
the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See the bug and feature
request trackers at SourceForge for inspiration, and if you intend to do
anything, please discuss it on the rosegarden-devel mailing list.

Be warned that we intend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


User documentation
------------------

See the Help menu.  Help -> Rosegarden Handbook; Help -> Online Tutorial


Developer documentation
-----------------------

All the documentation we have is in the docs/ subdirectory.  Good
starting-points include:

  docs/howtos/alsa-notes -- brief notes about getting and installing the
	ALSA sound drivers (we recommend ALSA for use with Rosegarden)
  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound with aRts
	(not recommended!)

  docs/code/global_design.txt -- which classes do what, more or less
  docs/data_struct/units.txt -- how we store pitch and time
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

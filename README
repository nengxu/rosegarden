Rosegarden-4 v0.9
=================

Rosegarden-4 is a MIDI and audio sequencer and musical notation editor.
This is an pre-beta release of the application mainly intended for 
adventurous end users, developers and other interested parties.  It is
not yet really stable enough to even call beta quality so please bear
this in mind and keep an eye on the FAQ for known problems and workarounds:

Build requirements
------------------

The big requirement is KDE 3.x, or more specifically the KDE 3.x
development libraries (you don't need the whole KDE environment).

Our code compiles with gcc-3.x.


Compiling from source
---------------------

If you obtained the source code from the SourceForge CVS repository:

  just grab one of the developers' configure scripts such as
  "gl_configure", edit it to your needs (you will most likely first
  need to change the Qt and KDE install paths in the script according
  to your setup), and run it. It will setup your source tree so you'll
  just have to run "make" afterwards.

  For more info, you can refer to the "COMPILING" file found in the
  KDE source code for a description of how to compile code from CVS,
  but the xx_configure scripts should perform the actions described in
  that file for you (make -f Makefile.cvs ; ./configure...).

  After configuring, run "make" and, if the compile succeeds, "make
  install".  (The pixmaps need to be installed to the global KDE
  directories before the application will run correctly.)


If you obtained the source code from a distribution tarball: 

  Just run 

    ./configure

  plus appropriate "--with-qt-dir=..." and "--prefix=..." options.
  Then proceed with "make" and "make install".


NOTE: The installation prefix should be the same as the one of your
KDE installation. However you can install to another directory, but
then you'll have to append it to your KDEDIRS variable. For instance :

KDEDIRS=/usr:/home/glaurent/rosegarden


Running the application
-----------------------
Just run the "rosegarden" application (found in the KDE bin directory
after installation, and also in the gui/ directory of the source tree).
The sequencer process is started automatically when the gui is started,
provided it has been correctly installed (by "make install") in the
global KDE directories.  If you have any problems running the application
then consult the FAQ:

http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden

or if that doesn't answer your question then use the rosegarden-user
mailing list on Sourceforge.

You can also "make uninstall" to uninstall the application if you
decide it's a waste of your time.


Notes for developers
--------------------

We are actively seeking developers who are interested in coding new
parts of the application, adding features, and fixing bugs.  See
the files in docs/task_lists/ for some idea of the things
we're already thinking about doing for the next developer release.
Good ideas are also welcome.

Be warned that we intend to be fairly strict about code quality... as
far as that's possible, given the not always superb standards of our
own code.


Documentation
-------------

All the documentation we have is in the docs/ subdirectory.  Good
starting-points include:

  docs/howtos/artsd-mcop-notes.txt -- notes on how to get sound

  docs/code/global_design.txt -- which classes do what, more or less
  docs/data_struct/units.txt -- how we store pitch and time
  docs/data_struct/sets.txt -- some terminology explained

  docs/discussion/tasks_available.txt and
  docs/discussion/0.2_planned_tasks.txt -- ideas for what to do next

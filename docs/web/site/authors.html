    <h3>Authors</h3>
    <p>Rosegarden-4 has three core developers, who between them are to
    blame for most of the application as you find it now.  Their email
    addresses are shown below in obfuscated form - change the "at" to "@"
    and the "dot" to "." to form the valid addresses.

    <p>
    Chris first started working on Rosegarden at the end of 1993.  It
    was then a university project for two students, devised by
    professor <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/">John Fitch</a>
    at the University of Bath, with <a
    href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/space/">Andy Green</a>
    working on the MIDI sequencer and Chris on the notation editor.
    They were the sole developers until late in 1995, some time after
    the barely-usable 1.0 release.  For Rosegarden-4, Chris is
    responsible for most of the notation rendering and some of the
    file and data code.

    lives in London.  He's been working on Rosegarden since the end of
    1995, when he was drafted in to take over the Unix sequencer.  He is
    responsible for almost all the MIDI, audio, sequencing and
    recording code in Rosegarden-4.

    alt=" "/>Guillaume lives in Cannes, in the South of France.
    He's been using Linux since 1995, and first worked on
    Rosegarden in the summer of 1996, when he supplied a few hundred
    lines of new code in his first couple of emails.  Guillaume is
    responsible for getting the Rosegarden-4 project restarted, for
    creating the basic design and writing much of the GUI code and
    file and data framework, and for most of the project administration.

    <p>He has also helped maintain <a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtk--</a> for a while, and is
    involved in some parts of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> here and there.  In his spare time,
    he works as a software engineer.

      and MIDI sequencer</b>, <b>score editor</b>, and general-purpose
      <b>music composition and editing application</b> for <b>Unix</b>

      quality, following two years of sustained active
      development.</p>

      <p><i><b>In latest news:</b></i> Rosegarden-4 is featured in the

      <p>Rosegarden-4 is Free Software under the GNU GPL.  It is a KDE
      application, which means to build it you need the KDE 3.x
      libraries.  However, once installed it can be run within the KDE
      environment or any other desktop or window manager
      environment.</p>

      <p><small>Note: if you have a Linux distribution that includes a
      package simply called <code>rosegarden</code>, you almost
      certainly have <a href="2.1/index.html">Rosegarden-2.1</a>.  (We always recommend that
      Rosegarden-4 is packaged as <code>rosegarden4</code>.) Consider
      upgrading!</small></p>

      <h2>Rosegarden-2.1</h2>

      <p><a href="2.1/index.html">Rosegarden-2.1</a> is a quite
      separate and much older program, containing a reasonable score
      editor and a reasonably useless sequencer with limited
      integration between the two.  It's very useful for certain
      tasks, particularly on older hardware, but Rosegarden-4 is where
      all the fancy new stuff is at.</p>

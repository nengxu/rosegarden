    <h3>Demonstrations of Rosegarden-4</h3>

    <p>If you're based in the UK and want to find out more about
    Rosegarden-4 then we'd be more than happy to talk to you with a
    view to demonstrating some of the features in person.  We provide
    this service for schools, businesses or individuals according to how
    much time we have and where you're based.  </p>

    <p>
    Please <a href="authors.html">send us an email</a> if you
    want to take advantage of this service or want to talk to us further
    about Rosegarden and making music under Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
    We're usually out an about around the country at an expo during
    the year.  You can come and talk to us there.   The next one is 
    the <a href="http://www.linuxuserexpo.com">Linux User and Developer Expo</a>
    in Birmingham, UK on 24th-26th June 2003.

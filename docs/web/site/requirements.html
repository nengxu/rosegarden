    <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

    <p> Rosegarden-4 is a MIDI and audio sequencer and notation editor
    and its system requirements differ according to what task you're
    using it for.  Editing, playing and recording MIDI is a less
    resource hungry mode of operation than recording or playing audio.
    The use of multiple audio plugins or soft-synths will especially
    impact system performance, and it's worth bearing your projected
    usage in mind when specifying your machine.  </p>

    <p> For a PC, minimum hardware requirements for running
    Rosegarden-4 for MIDI use with simple editing and
    playback/recording is a 400MHz system with 64MB of memory.  A
    recommended system is an 800MHz system with 256MB of memory - with
    this setup you should have enough power to sequence MIDI and audio
    with a small number of audio plugins.  For serious audio use
    and/or use with a serious number of high-quality soft synths,
    you'll need significantly more processor power.</p>

    <h3>Software requirements</h3>

    <p> Rosegarden-4 uses the KDE libraries, so you will need <a
    href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 2.2 with <a
    href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a>2 or KDE 3 with Qt 3.  (KDE
    2.1 is not supported.)  You don't actually need to use the KDE
    desktop, you just need the library packages installed on your
    system.</p>

    <p>
    If you want to hear sound from your system then you will also need
    to configure a soundcard supported by the
    <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_blank">ALSA project</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Audio support is provided by the 
    <a href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net">JACK</a> sound server.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're using an external MIDI device (sound module or keyboard)
    then you'll also need the appropriate leads and cables.  For help
    setting up your home studio for easy audio and MIDI recording then
    you can consult
    <a href="http://www.bownie.com/guide"  target="_blank">Bownie's DIY Guide to Recording</a>.

    Please also consult the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>Building from source code</h3>
    
    <p>In order to build Rosegarden-4, you will need a Unix-like operating
    system, the gcc-2.9x or 3.x C++ compiler, <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 2.2 with <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a>2 or KDE3
    wth Qt3.  See the <a
    href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for solutions to a few build and installation
    problems.

    <p>Other related software that you may wish to build with includes:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> 0.9 or better
          (<b>highly recommended</b> - much better sound rendering than with KDE's aRts), but your distribution most likely
          carries it already, except RedHat which as of 8.0 still ships Alsa 0.5)</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net">JACK</a> (Jack Audio Connection Kit) for audio.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a> (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API), for audio plugins.</li>

    </ul>

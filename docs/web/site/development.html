      <h3>Current Rosegarden development works</h3>
      
      <h4>The short answer</h4>

      <p>Yes, we're still working on it.  "Rosegarden 4", or whatever
      it ends up being called, will be a KDE-based application that
      features close integration of a nice sequencer with a
      good-quality notation editor, and that will be fairly easy to
      extend.
      
      <h4>Motivation</h4>

      <p>The Rosegarden 2 code reached the end of its useful life
      about four years ago.  Its internal representation had become
      inadequate for the things we were wanting to do, and it was
      becoming too difficult to extend it without introducing some
      serious stability issues.  The GUI was looking rather
      antiquated, and it was too closely coupled with the rest of the
      application to be straightforward to replace.  We wanted closer
      communication between the notation-editing and sequencing parts
      of the application and the existing code just wasn't designed
      that way.

        <h4>History</h4>

      <p>Over the years, we've made several attempts to rewrite
      Rosegarden.  Here are some of them:

      <ul>
        <li>Late 1995: Completely abortive attempt by Chris to port
        the GUI to Motif.</li>

        <li>1995-1996: Andy makes a sibling version of Rosegarden for
        Microsoft Windows, adding a significant amount of extra
        sequencer functionality.  Then he loses the only copy of the
        source code in a hard disc crash.  You can still have the <a
        href="ftp://ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/ROSE/rose10b1.zip">32-bit
        binaries</a> if you like, but they might not work.  Don't come
        crying to us if you blow up your computer.</li>

        <li>Early 1996: Inspired by Guillaume's strange fascination
        with Tcl/Tk, we give serious consideration to rewriting the
        GUI using Tk.  Rather fortunately, we don't actually get as
        far as writing any code.</li>

        <li>Early 1998: Following a brief dalliance with Objective C,
        we begin a ground-up rewrite of the notation editor in C++
        using the GTK-- toolkit.  It reaches the stage of being able
        to load a Rosegarden 2.1 file (using a new parser written with
        the PCCTS system) and bring up a few empty windows.  Some
        amount of core container code written by Chris, and some GUI
        code by Guillaume.  Abandoned when we decided the basic
        architecture was still going to be inadequate for the amount
        of editor-sequencer integration we'd like to be able to do.
        Here's the <a
        href="http://www.cannam.demon.co.uk/rosegarden/development/rosegarden-c++-980610.tar.gz">source
        code</a> as it was when we abandoned it: 5,600 lines of C++
        that's probably nearly impossible to compile by now.</li>

        <li>June 1998: A session in the pub with Bownie and Chris
        leads to the start of "Rosegarden 3.0", a Grand Unified
        Rewrite.  We aimed to produce a system where the music was
        stored in a separate, server datastore and made available to a
        set of editing and performance clients via CORBA objects,
        implemented once again in C++ using GTK--, with MICO as the
        CORBA ORB to begin with.  This design had a lot of potential:
        if we'd been three talented programmers working on it
        full-time, we could have produced a very nice modular,
        extensible, rather slow system.  In practice, however, we
        spent a lot of time talking about it, then Chris spent a month
        writing a working datastore implementation then went on
        holiday for six months, during which time nobody else managed
        to get to grips with the rather complicated code.  And when
        Chris got back, he found he'd also forgotten how it worked.
        We end up deciding to drop CORBA and do something simpler
        instead.  You can pick up the <a
        href="http://www.cannam.demon.co.uk/rosegarden/development/000125.tar.gz">last
        source code for this version</a> if you like -- it's about
        12,000 lines of C++ and IDL that's a beastly pain to compile
        and does nothing worth looking at.  It's very clever
        though.</li>

        <li>April 2000: Following his departure from the GTK--
        development team and disillusionment with the GNOME project,
        Guillaume begins building a Rosegarden GUI using Qt for KDE.
        By working on the GUI first, with relatively little structure
        underneath (except a set of generic event objects developed by
        Chris), he at last manages to get something visible out of it.
        Project development moves <a
        href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rosegarden/">to SourceForge</a>,
        like all other God-fearing free-software projects. Progress is
        still slow, partly because Chris and Bownie are far too busy
        at work to help out much.</li>

        <li>June 2000: Fifth anniversary of the release of Rosegarden
        1.0.  The oldest Rosegarden code (the help system, strangely
        enough) is now over seven years old.  It's more than two and a
        half years since Rosegarden 2.1 came out.</li>

        <li>April 2001: After Chris and Bownie manage to find a bit
        more spare time and join Guillaume in actually putting in some
        real work, progress speeds up somewhat.  We decide on a firm
        set of basic features required for a public 0.1 developer
        release.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>And that's where we are at the moment.  Our mantra is now:

        <blockquote><b>"If we lose focus again, Rosegarden is dead.
        It has already been brought back from limbo a couple of times,
        there won't be a next one."</b></blockquote>

      (&copy; Guillaume) <p>At the time of writing, we've made the 0.1
      release (in October) plus a couple more, have passed 3,500 CVS
      commits and have written vastly more lines of code than we
      managed in any of the previous rewrites.  Things are looking
      modestly positive.

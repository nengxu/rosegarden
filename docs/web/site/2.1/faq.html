<p> Unix, Linux and OpenVMS.

<p>Rosegarden does <b>not</b> run on Microsoft Windows, and it
probably never will.

<p>Binaries are available for Linux and SGI IRIX; for other machines,
you will need to build it yourself from the source distribution.  We
would expect this to work on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX and HP-UX
at least, but we haven't necessarily tested it.

<p> 

<P>Rosegarden is free software, licensed under the <A
HREF="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</A>'s GNU General
Public Licence (GPL).  That gives you a lot of freedom to redistribute it

<a name="playback"><span class="faqheader">"What hardware and software will I need if I want to hear anything?" </span></a>

<p> 

While the notation editor and sequencer will build and run on most
Unix machines, you'll need some sound hardware and/or drivers if you 
want to be able to play anything audibly.  The following systems are
known or expected to work:
<UL>
<LI>
If you are running Linux or FreeBSD, you'll need the kernel 
    sound drivers (<A
HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/ossfree/">OSS/Free</A>, OSS/Linux or
the old VoxWare).  Any
    external MIDI synth should play fine; some internal soundcards
    will work, notably the SoundBlaster series.  Other cards <i>might</i> work, but we can't tell you which ones; it all depends on the drivers.

<LI>
If you are running SGI IRIX 5.x, you should be able to play
    through any external MIDI synth; using IRIX 6.x, the internal
    software synth should also work.  Older versions of Rosegarden
    (up to and including 2.0.1) could also drive external synths
    from the Indigo under IRIX 4.x; newer versions can't. 

<LI>
If you are running any other Unix system, you'll be able 
    to make sounds if you have an <A
HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/oss.html">OSS</A> (Open Sound System)
driver.
    These are commercial drivers for various Unices; Rosegarden
    should work with any of them, at least to drive external MIDI
    devices.  See <A HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/">4Front
    Technologies</A> for details.

<li>Finally, Rosegarden can use an external MIDI playback program such
as <a href="http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/">TiMidity</a>
to play music, although you don't get any control over the playback
from within Rosegarden when using an external player.  To use an
external playback program, use the "Play through Slave" menu
function on the sequencer's File menu.
</UL>

<a name="recording"><span class="faqheader">"What hardware and software will I need if I want to record things?" </span></a>

<p> 

Rosegarden should be able to record on any system from which it can
play.  In practice this probably isn't true, but we don't have many
facilities for testing recording, so we don't really know. 

</div>
<div class="faqanswer">
<a href="#"><img src="../block.gif" alt="^ " width="8" height="8" border="2"></a>&nbsp; 
<a name="playcfg"><span class="faqheader">"How do I configure the sequencer for MIDI on my Unix machine?" </span></a>

<p> 

<P>If you're building Rosegarden yourself from a source distribution, 
the configure script will try to determine what system you have and
configure the compilation of Rosegarden accordingly.  In the Sequencer
itself, most of the code is system-independent.  (The only exception
is a small amount of code for the cosmetics of high-level user control
over the system's handling of the I/O timing.)  The vast majority of 
the platform dependent code is to be found in the Mapper subsystem.
This code, as with the Sequencer, is conditionally compiled according
to the system type and deals with all the details of supported UNIX
systems.  The intention is that the specifics of what is compiled when
and where should be transparent to the user during compilation: the
configuration should be done for you.

<P>Note however that Rosegarden doesn't have sound support for all 
flavours of UNIX.  Check <A HREF="#playback">whether yours
should be supported</A>, and <A HREF="#unsupported">what
you can do about it if it isn't</A>.

<a name="sb16"><span class="faqheader">"How do I play and record through my SoundBlaster-compatible soundcard
in Linux?" </span></a>

<p> 

<P>First thing to do is to check how your OSS or OSS/Free system is setup
on your Linux box.  Type <CODE>cat /dev/sndstat</CODE> to list what
devices are available.  We are interested in two types, Midi and Synth
devices.

<P>Midi devices as far as Rosegarden are concerned are those that
carry a hardware interface to an external MIDI instrument.  This could
be a keyboard or a MIDI soundbox.  A Midi device can be used as a
recording interface, but note that <I>Rosegarden 2.1 will take the
first (i.e. 0th) Midi device as the Recording device</I>, it is not
directly configurable.  Of course by recompiling the kernel the first
Midi device could be changed...  On opening the Midi Setup dialog from
the Midi menu on the Rosegarden Sequencer you will see the Record
Device listed for you.  Note that on some cards the name of the device
is misleading - for example my hardware MIDI interface is called
"Sound Blaster".  Look at <CODE>/dev/sndstat</CODE> for the
authoritative answer.

<P>For playback there is more than MIDI device available.  The
on-board synth (FM synth) on SB16 compatibles is initialised and
usable by the Rosegarden Sequencer.  Depending on your kernel
configuration and age of the Linux distribution you may be able to use
other types of onboard synths (e.g. AWE-32 or GUS), but this is very
much a matter of the driver configuration and the patch level of the
particular system.  Sometimes a device could appear as available for
playback when it won't actually make any noise on playback.  Examine 
<CODE>/dev/sndstat</CODE> for the list of Synth devices available.

<P>Playback devices can be set up by the user.  If more than one
eligible playback device exists then another pseduo device, the
"All" device becomes available.  This does what it says - plays a
track to all devices available for playback.

<P>There are two options for changing the playback device.  The
current device is shown on the tracklist on the main sequencer window
along with a track status (either Active or Mute, see Muting further
on for an explanation of this behaviour).  On opening the Event list
for a track you will notice the device is displayed at the bottom of
the window.  This is a menu selector itself and by clicking on the
device name you can select which device this track will play to.  The
Track list is updated with your selection immediately.  Alternatively
on the Track menu there is an option to "Change All to Device..."
which allows you to quickly change all the tracks to a single device
in the dialog.

<P>Along with track devices the user can mute tracks.  The Track menu
again offers two options to either Mute All Tracks or to Activate All
Tracks.  Again on the Eventlist window for each track there is also a
label with the current track status.  By clicking on the label the
user can toggle the status of the track.

<a name="unsupported"><span class="faqheader">"My Unix machine isn't supported for MIDI playback or recording from 
the Sequencer.  Is there anything I can do about that?" </span></a>

<p> 

Yes, if you know how to write code that uses your machine's MIDI 
driver API.  (Assuming your OS <em>has</em> a MIDI driver API.
If it hasn't, forget it.) 
<P>

Rosegarden uses a library (called Mapper) that maps generic musical
events from the sequencer into whatever API your own MIDI drivers use,
and vice versa.  It works somewhat like the Microsoft Windows MIDI
mapper.  To add support for another MIDI driver, just write another
mapper wrapper.  You will need a good knowledge of C, some knowledge
of the device driver for your system's MIDI hardware, some spare time 
and some spare hair.

<P>If you get the Rosegarden source distribution and look in the
"mapper" subdirectory under the top-level directory, you'll
find a file called SUPPORT that tells you some stuff about how the
Mapper library works.  If you need to know more, ask on the
mailing-list or by email to Rich Bown, <A
HREF="mailto:rich@clara.net">bownie@bownie.com</A>.

<P>If you succeed in concocting a mapper for your hardware or
operating-system MIDI driver, <em>please</em> send us a copy of the
source so we can include it in the distribution.

<a name="muting"><span class="faqheader">"Some MIDI timing information is being ignored." </span></a>

<P>If a track with Tempo or Time signature information is Muted, then
this "Meta" information will not be used when playing the piece.
This can cause some strange effects: for example the piece may play as
fast as it possibly can!  Try un-muting all the tracks.

<a name="recplay"><span class="faqheader">"Can I hear the tracks I've got already when I'm recording?" </span></a>

<p> 

<P>Playback during recording is available as of Rosegarden 2.1
although its behaviour (only proven on OSS/Linux) can be erratic.  All
tracks will play on selected devices during recording.  Note also that
with the fast forward and rewind button it is possible to record a new
track starting at any point in the piece.  If you do not want to hear
the tracks played during recording then simply mute them all from the
Track menu - note however that muting all tracks may have undesirable
effects on playback due to differing time signatures in recorded and
already existing MIDI events.  A MIDI file with no tempo information
will be given default a tempo of 120 bpm automatically following the
completion of recording (by hitting the Stop button or selecting Stop
from the File menu).

<a name="csound"><span class="faqheader">"I can't get Csound to work." </span></a>

<p>  

That's okay.  None of us understands Csound either. 
<P>
The sequencer only writes Csound score files; it can't create 
orchestra files.  I suspect the score files produced by Rosegarden
require a rather specific format of orchestra file, or else some
postprocessing.
<P>
There's a lot of information about Csound at <A
HREF="http://www.csounds.com/">csounds.com</A>, but to be honest, if you don't 
already know an awful lot of stuff about Csound you'd probably be 
better off spending a few months learning about it than trying to cut
corners with Rosegarden.  That's just my opinion, speaking as someone 
who hasn't got a clue either. 

<p><b><i>Kevin Conder writes:</i></b> I created a trivial score with
Rosegarden and exported it to a MIDI file. I then used Rosegarden to
export the MIDI file to a Csound score. With this score, I was able to
create an complementary orchestra.

<p>It was pretty straight-forward. It correctly generated notes for
the first instrument (i1...). The fourth p-field, p4, in the score file is
the note's frequency as a pitch-class. One can convert this to
cycles-per-second using the cpspch opcode:
<blockquote><code>
	 icps = cpspch(p4)
</code></blockquote>

<p>The fifth p-field, p5, is the note's midi velocity (0-127). Since
Csound's amplitude is currently 0-32767, one can convert p5 to an 
approximate amplitude value by multiplying it by 256:
<blockquote><code>
	iamp = p5 * 256
</code></blockquote>

<a name="scores"><span class="faqheader">"What do I need to produce printed scores?" </span></a>

<p> 

Rosegarden isn't a typesetting system and its capabilities for 
producing scores are limited.  In the current version, the best it can
do is to write a MusicTeX, OpusTeX or PMX (<A
HREF="#opustex">q.v.</A>) file, which can then be
processed and printed.  To do this, you'll need TeX with MusicTeX, 
MusiXTeX or OpusTeX, and some kind of DVI processor or driver for your
printer; to use PMX, you'll also need PMX itself.  If you don't know
what TeX is, you should probably spend a couple of months finding out
first.  <P> Future versions of Rosegarden will also be able to produce
PostScript output directly, which should be easier for many people.

</div>
<div class="faqanswer">
<a href="#"><img src="../block.gif" alt="^ " width="8" height="8" border="2"></a>&nbsp; 
<a name="opustex"><span class="faqheader">"What about MusicTeX, OpusTeX and PMX?  What's the difference?" </span></a>

<p>  

These are all music-printing tools that use the TeX typesetting
engine.  They offer the only way, at the moment, of printing music
from Rosegarden, but you'll need a working TeX installation before you 
can install and use any of them.

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/music/musictex/">MusicTeX</A> is the
oldest of these macro packages, and is no longer actively being
developed.  Instead development work has divided into two derived
packaged: MusiXTeX and OpusTeX.  <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/music/musixtex">MusiXTeX</A> is designed to
be able to process MusicTeX scores, though, so you can use
Rosegarden's MusicTeX export facility with MusiXTeX as well. 

<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/incoming/opustex/atwork/">OpusTeX</A>
is also derived from MusicTeX, but is not back-compatible, aiming to
be simple, general and efficient rather than inclusive.  It looks
interesting for the future but it's still relatively young, having yet 
to reach an official 1.0 release, and keeps changing.  For the moment
Rosegarden's OpusTeX export is probably mostly of interest to people 
who use OpusTeX already.

<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/music/musixtex/software/pmx/">PMX</A> is
a preprocessor for MusiXTeX: it takes input in a simple ASCII format
and produces MusiXTeX output (which can only be used with MusiXTeX,
not MusicTeX or OpusTeX).  Because the input format is
straightforward, it's easier for Rosegarden to produce mechanically. 
You therefore get better output, mostly, by using this export option,
processing through PMX and then MusiXTeX.  PMX can't cope with very 
complicated scores, but then at the moment neither can Rosegarden.

<a name="counterpoint"><span class="faqheader">"Can I write counterpoint?" </span></a>

<p> 

If you mean, can you write more than one voice onto a single staff
with differing time values, then no.  Rosegarden sees a staff as a
succession of chords, each containing a set of notes of equal length.
(Okay, so there are rests and groups and things too, but that's 
basically it.)  If you want to write counterpoint, you'll have to use 
more than one staff.  I'm sorry.  (We hope this situation might 
change, of course, but at the moment that's how it is.)

<a name="parts"><span class="faqheader">"How can I extract individual parts from a score?" </span></a>

<p> 

Use cut-and-paste, for the moment.  If you want to extract a single
staff: first create a new piece with just one staff in it; then
outline the whole staff you want to extract on the original piece (you
can do that by triple-clicking the mouse on it in edit mode); then use
Copy from the Edit menu, and go to the new piece and use Paste.

<a name="volume"><span class="faqheader">"It doesn't do what I expect with the volume levels in MIDI playback." </span></a>

<p>  

By default, the Editor ignores any dynamics you've put in the score 
when it turns the score into MIDI.  It will, however, put some
emphasis on the first note in each bar.  Both of these things can be
changed.
<P>
If you want to stop the Editor adding emphasis to the first note of
each bar, you should change the "midiBarEmphasis" resource in the
supplied resource file (normally just called Rosegarden) before you
run the Editor.  If you don't define this at all in the file, it'll
default to 15, which means the Editor will add 15 points of MIDI
amplitude to the first note in each bar.  (MIDI amplitude is measured
on a scale of 0 to 127.)  Set it to zero, and these notes will be
treated the same way as all the others.
<P>
The Editor also contains some rather experimental code for doing other
dynamics, which is switched off by default because it's, well, rather 
experimental.  You can elect to use this by setting the "midiDynamics"
resource to True in the resource file; the Editor will then try to
observe hairpin dynamics and to follow textual indications that have
been explicitly entered as dynamics using the Dynamic function on the
Text menu.  (In general, it gets a bit confused if you have lots of
hairpins with few textual marks.)  You can't (yet) change the 
amplitudes it assigns to the various textual markings.
<P>
One other thing you can't control is that the Editor will always add a 
bit of emphasis to notes that have accent ("&gt;") marks over them.  If
you don't want it to, don't use accents.

<a name="petal"><span class="faqheader">"What is Petal for?" </span></a>

<p> 

<P>Petal is a scripting language, similar in principle to Cakewalk's
"CAL".  It is based on Tcl and TclMIDI.

<P>Its main use is to write filters, to automatically process your
MIDI or notation files. Filters add new functionalities to Rosegarden
the same way Emacs Lisp macros do to Emacs, or shell scripts do to
your regular command line. More generally, you could use it for many
more complex things, like algorithmic composition.

<a name="petalw"><span class="faqheader">"Do I want it?" </span></a>

<p> 

<P>Hard to tell <CODE>:-)</CODE>. Consider all the things you can do
with your favourite text editor: yet sometimes, you leave it and get a
tool like sed, awk, grep, Perl, whatever to perform a stupid,
systematic job which would be an incredible burden to do
interactively. That's what Petal is intended for. 

<p><b>But</b>, at the moment it seems that whatever the replacement
for Rosegarden 2.1 looks like, it will not support the current
Tcl-based form of the Petal scripting language.  There will probably
eventually be some sort of scripting capability in future versions of
Rosegarden, but it will not be Petal.

<a name="petalhow"><span class="faqheader">"How can I tell if Petal has been installed?  How do I make it

<p> 

<P>If you're <b>compiling from sources</B>, Petal will only be built 
if you have Tcl v7.5 and <A
HREF="http://madonna.me.berkeley.edu/~greg/tclmidi/">TclMIDI</A>
installed, and if the location of TclMIDI is in your
<CODE>TCLLIBPATH</CODE>.

<P>Check what the <CODE>configure</CODE> script tells you when you
start building Rosegarden: it should let you know if it isn't going to 
build Petal.  If it <I>has</I> been built, you should have a <CODE>Petal.so</CODE>
file in the rosegarden/petal directory, which the
<CODE>do-install</CODE> script should install for you in a sensible
place.

<P>If you're <b>installing from a binary distribution</B>, the Petal 
shared-object and Tcl files will be installed regardless (if they're 
included in the distribution at all -- check for <CODE>Petal.so</CODE> in the
tarfile).  You won't be able to use them unless you have Tcl v7.5 or 
newer and your <CODE>TCLLIBPATH</CODE> is set correctly; if you want
to use them from the sequencer, you'll also need TclMIDI. 

<P>Note that although <CODE>TCLLIBPATH</CODE> is an environment
variable to be set from the shell, <b>it will be interpreted as a Tcl
list</B>, not a conventional shell path, so it must use <b>spaces for
delimiters instead of colons</B>.  Thus for instance
<PRE>    "/usr/lib/tclmidi&nbsp;/home/tcl"</PRE> is a valid
<CODE>TCLLIBPATH</CODE>, while
<PRE>    "/usr/lib/tclmidi:/home/tcl"</PRE> is extremely unlikely to make
sense.  (This is not our fault -- it's a Tcl feature.) 

<P>If Petal has not been installed correctly, the `Filter' menu will 
be inactivated on the sequencer and editor windows.

<P>Of course, once you've installed it, you then have to write some 
filters if you want it to be of much use.  The best way to start is to
check the sample scripts: <CODE>harmonizer.tcl</CODE> and
<CODE>pattern.tcl</CODE>.  To continue from there, read the Petal
documentation: there's a copy of it in the Rosegarden help.

<P>Well.  Could be anything, really.  But if you're getting errors 
about undefined system functions or that look like inconsistencies in
system headers, the first thing to try is to remove the
<CODE>-DPOSIX_PLEASE</CODE> from the DEFINES line of the top-level
Makefile (after running <CODE>configure</CODE>) and rebuild.

We are doing.  The result is called <A HREF="../index.html">Rosegarden-4</A>.

<p>If you're planning anything substantial, it's almost certainly better to <A HREF="../development.html">contribute to Rosegarden-4</A>.

<P>Nonetheless, fixes to the current code -- or even extensions -- are
still welcome.  If you have a piece of code you'd like to see
included, please contact <A

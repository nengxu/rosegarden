<H1>Bug Submission Guidelines</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you discover a problem with
Rosegarden, you can help us a great deal by performing the following
steps when submitting bug reports. We realize that wading through
these guidelines and then following them means more work for you, and
we thank you in advance for taking the time to help us help you. For
your part, it is a waste of your time to report an issue that no one
will ever address, and for ours, it is more often than not a waste of
our limited resources to follow up on reports that are not made in
accordance with these guidelines.</P>

		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Try to come up with a word or
	expression that anyone who submitted this issue previously would
	have used in the description. You have a better chance of finding
	the previous bugs if you use terms that are as generic and simple as
	possible. SourceForge will not return any hits unless it finds <B>all</B>
	of the terms you enter in one of the bug summaries, and it cannot
	search the text of the reports directly. Consequently, a search for
	&ldquo;audio&rdquo; or &ldquo;audio segment&rdquo; is more likely to
	find something than a search for &ldquo;audio segment resize
	problem.&rdquo; Bear in mind spelling differences between the US and
	the rest of the English speaking world as well. SourceForge won't
	find reports about &ldquo;bad behaviour&rdquo; that were submitted
	by an American who spelled it &ldquo;bad behavior,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Input your search into the
	&ldquo;Summary keyword:&rdquo; box. Hit the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo;
	button.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there were no results, go back
	and try other keywords until you run out of ideas, or until you get
	sick of wrestling with the lousy search facility at SourceForge. We
	appreciate your making an effort to find existing reports, but we
	don't expect you to waste an hour of your life trying to coax
	something out of that admittedly very lame search facility either.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you did find a result, or
	results, read through the previous reports and see if your bug is
	already described. If it is not described to your satisfaction, you
	can add additional comments to existing reports, if appropriate.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there is no previous work to
	draw on, then you should continue on to file a new report.</P>

</P>
<H2>Submit a New Report</H2>
<P>Once you have made a reasonable effort to ensure that you have
discovered a new issue, then please continue with the following
guidelines in mind.</P>
<H3>Bug or Whine?</H3>
<P>Is it a real bug, or do you just perceive it as a bug because the
software you grew up on did things differently? Try to take
Rosegarden on its own terms, and try to be realistic when deciding
whether a particular complaint is a true bug or merely a feature
request. If it's a feature request, don't try to sneak it onto the
radar screen by branding it a bug. File it as a feature request. (See
the guidelines at
<A
HREF="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/RFE-guidelines.html">http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/RFE-guidelines.html</A>
for more details.)</P>
<H3>Bugs to Avoid</H3>
<P>Build or installation problems make for particularly useless bug
reports, and packaging problems are completely between you and your
distro package maintainer(s). Please deal with these issues on the
<A HREF="mailto:rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">rosegarden-devel</A>
mailing list unless specifically asked to do otherwise.</P>
<H3>Don't Be a Nobody</H3>
<P>Please take the time to create a SourceForge account for yourself
and use it for submitting and tracking your bug reports. The process
of working out a solution to an issue and determining whether or not
it is really fixed works best when you make yourself available for
followup questions, and when you take an active interest in looking
after your report. When you submit an issue as &ldquo;nobody,&rdquo;
it automatically decreases the chances that anyone will ever address
the problem you're reporting. Especially if your initial report is
insufficient for us to determine exactly what the problem is in the
first place.</P>
<H3>Repeatability is Critical</H3>
<P>A bug report that isn't repeatable is a waste of everyone's time.
We realize that random things happen to random people at random
times, and there are a number of real bugs we have been unable to
puzzle out. Reporting things like &ldquo;something went wrong with
this file but I can't repeat it&rdquo; is, sadly, a waste of your
time and ours. We're certain something did indeed go wrong, but
unless you can come up with a series of steps that cause the problem
to manifest consistently, or at least frequently, then we will never
be able to solve the problem, and it is pointless for us to try.</P>
<P>Having said that, &ldquo;something went wrong with this file, and
now when I do this, this happens&rdquo; is perfectly acceptable. It
is not as good as helping us determine how the file wound up in a bad
state in the first place through a repeatable procedure, but if the
bad state that you're in here and now leads on to consistent,
repeatable results, it's a starting place, and problems like this can
occasionally be solved.</P>
<H3>Keep it Simple</H3>
<P>You should make every effort to reduce a problem to the smallest,
least complicated number of steps that can produce the bad result,
and you should describe this procedure using as few words as
possible. If you see something happen in the context of working on a
complex composition, it is usually beneficial to save this work, set
it aside, start a new file, and attempt to reproduce the problem in a
controlled test environment, using the fewest steps possible. The
shorter and more concise your report, the more likely it is that we
will fix it. On the other hand, the longer and more complex your
report, the more likely it is that we will skip over it time and
again in favor of something easier to digest.</P>
<H3>One Bug per Report</H3>
<P>You should avoid the temptation to save yourself effort by
combining different issues into one massive report. If there are
three related aspects to the same overriding problem, then file each
of these aspects separately. Under no circumstances should you ever
file a &ldquo;big bug list&rdquo; report that reels off a laundry
list of separate, unrelated issues.</P>
<P>Here are some <B>good</B> examples. These all relate to audio
segments, but they are filed as distinct issues. They try to be to
the point and repeatable.</P>
<P><A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1223299&amp;group_id=4932&amp;atid=104932">Audio
segment preview not aligned to tempo ruler</A></P>
<P><A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1223295&amp;group_id=4932&amp;atid=104932">Removed
audio segments still playing</A></P>
<P><A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1224659&amp;group_id=4932&amp;atid=104932">audio
segment selected after insert from file manager</A></P>
<P>It would have been terrible to combine them into one single
&ldquo;problems with audio segments&rdquo; report instead, for
example. Worse yet would have been something like this particularly
egregious example of a <B>bad</B> bug report:</P>
<P><A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=740273&amp;group_id=4932&amp;atid=104932">Juan's
big list</A></P>
<P>This &ldquo;big list&rdquo; report was filed by one of us, so we
well understand this temptation to lump things together like this. We
have erred, but do as we say, not as we have done in a moment of
wrong thinking.</P>
<H3>Assigning a Category</H3>
<P>You are free to try to determine what category your bug belongs
to, and to assign it both to a category and to a particular
developer. If you aren't sure what category to use, or which
developer should handle this particular problem, then leaving it
unassigned is perfectly acceptable, and preferable to assigning it
incorrectly.</P>
<H3>Producing a Stack Trace</H3>
<P>If your bug involves a crash, then we will often come back and ask
you to produce a stack trace if you didn't include one. In order to
produce a useful trace from a standard user environment, you probably
need to perform a few steps.</P>
<P>Go to a bash prompt (for example, run &ldquo;Terminal Program
(Konsole)&rdquo; from the KDE menu) and then issue these commands to
allow for the creation of core dumps, and to bypass the KDE bug
handler:</P>
for bash and similar shells:
<BLOCKQUOTE>ulimit -c unlimited</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ulimit -H -c unlimited</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>export KDE_DEBUG=1 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
for tsch and similar shells:
<BLOCKQUOTE>limit coredumpsize unlimited</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>setenv KDEDEBUG 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now start rosegarden from this same command line, and reproduce
the crash. You should now have a core file in your current directory.
The core file is either named &quot;core&quot; or &quot;core.&lt;number&gt;&quot;.
</P>
<P>Now run &ldquo;gdb&rdquo; : 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>gdb rosegarden &lt;core_file&gt;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now type &ldquo;where&rdquo; at the gdb prompt.  Let the trace run
to completion (or until it becomes apparent that it's in an infinite
loop) and copy the results, then paste them into your report.</P>
<H3>Priority</H3>
<P>Your bugs should be submitted at the default priority of 5. They
will be examined and assigned a new priority level in due course. See
<A HREF="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/bug-priorities.html">this
chart</A> for an explanation as to what various priority levels
represent.</P>

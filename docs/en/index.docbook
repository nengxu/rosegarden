    Notes on style and terminology for Rosegarden handbook
    ======================================================

     * Try to use British spelling and idiom as much as you possibly
       can, so the American bits don't stick out like a sore
       thumb.  Realise, not realize, colour, not color, though of
       course an American is going to miss using colorful (oops)
       British sayings like "a bit naff," and won't have any idea
       what the bloody hell (that was good, but a bit too vulgar, of
       course) words like "heuristic" mean.

     * Aim to be clear, brief and direct, but be informal.

     * Write instructions in the second person.

       Good:     "You can select segments by clicking on them with
                 the arrow tool."

       Bad:      "Segments can be selected by clicking on them with
                 the arrow tool."

       Very bad: "The arrow tool allows the user to select segments
                 by clicking on them."

       If you dislike the first of these because you want to make the
       phrase "the arrow tool" more obvious by placing it at the
       start of the sentence, then perhaps you should be using a
       variablelist instead and making "the arrow tool" a list item.

     * It's perfectly permissible to detour to explain why
       something is the way it is, particularly if it might not be
       obvious.

     * It's also entirely permissible to omit advanced stuff.  This
       document is be about understanding how and why, not about
       knowing every last clever detail.  Initially we were going to
       include a function reference section for the clever details,
       but it proved too hard to keep up to date, and not all that
       useful.  Providing a quick bit of guidance is most of the job.       

     * Bear in mind we can link extensively from any part of
       the handbook to any other.  Unfortunately DocBook won't allow
       you to write a link to a target that doesn't exist yet, so if
       you want to link to something that's not yet been written,
       either make a note of the planned link in an XML comment, or
       go and create a stub for the bit that hasn't been written yet,
       or else just write in a way that allows for a link to be
       easily added later (we could do an editing phase specially for
       links).

     * Be strict about using the correct terminology for
       Rosegarden data structures (segment, event, track, instrument,
       composition), but don't capitalise the words.  Capitalisation
       is useful in technical documents to make it clear that you're
       referring to a precise concept, but you shouldn't have to do
       it to make your meaning clear in user documentation.  If
       something seems ambiguous without, try rewording it instead.


    About Screenshots
    =================

    We recommend saving your current user preferences as a new theme
    using the KDE theme manager, so you can restore your usual
    desktop after your work on this manual is done.  Then we
    recommend that you spare yourself some effort, and use the
    "Rosegarden Handbook" KDE theme I just created, and put here:
    	
	http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/Rosegarden\ Handbook.kth

    If you can't use the theme for some reason, you must dial in
    these changes by hand.  Screenshots used with this documentation
    should use the following style, colour and font settings:

    (NOTE: These specs are from the KDE 2.x era, surely, and make no
    particular mention of icon themes.  I have no idea what icons
    were used in the original version of this document, since it was
    not specified.  I have used the new default "Crystal SVG" icons
    in creating the theme above.  This will probably result in a
    mis-match, but I find I really don't care.)

    (NOTE in reply to the above: the scheme was originally from
    KDE 2.x, yes.  I suggest we don't worry about icon mismatches too
    much, as most of the screenshots don't have icons in semantically
    meaningful roles anyway.  I use Crystal SVG too now and I don't 
    really intend to change that for the documentation.)

     * KDE Style: "Light Style, 3rd Revision"

     * Colour scheme: "Blue Slate", with high-contrast
       setting and with the standard widget background set to white.
       (I have this saved as a new scheme.)

     * Fonts: Verdana 11px for general use and menus; Verdana
       11px bold for window titles; antialiasing on, but sub-pixel
       antialiasing off.  (For pictures of the segment and instrument
       parameter boxes I usually turn the size up to 13px, which
       perhaps says something about our use of font size in these
       boxes.)  WARNING: This is not a reliable hint any more, as
       the KDE font size is not in pixels but points that depend
       on the detected monitor resolution.  Go for something that
       looks a bit like the existing screenshots; it will probably
       be smaller than 11pt.

       NOTE: switching off sub-pixel antialiasing is quite important,
       as otherwise your text will look weird and fuzzy to any
       readers with CRT monitors or LCDs with a different colour
       ordering.  The exact choice of font is less important: I
       think you can get away with Vera or whatever.

     * Window Decorations: "Quartz"

    None of these would be my first choice for nice-looking
    screenshots now, but we're not here to sell Rosegarden in this
    document, we're here to provide clear and consistent help text.
    So the priority is to make new screenshots look like the existing
    ones, not to make them look fancy.  Also, I think there is an
    advantage to having screenshots in a help document look a bit
    distinct from the user's own window decorations surrounding the
    help text.

    Screenshots of the whole program or of whole matrix or notation
    windows may be taken using different themes if desired, but
    screenshots of individual dialogs or window components must use
    the above scheme.

    Notes on Usability Defects
    ==========================

    This comment is a place to note anything I find difficult to
    document, or anything where the functions for two necessarily
    linked concepts are not actually linked in the GUI (etc).

    * The audio file directory (in document properties) can't be
      inspected or changed from the audio file manager.  This is
      arguably linked to a need for a project directory.  There
      are various other usability problems with the audio file
      manager as well, e.g. there's no way to tell it to pull all
      imported audio files into a single audio directory.

    * Track buttons showing sometimes-instrument, sometimes-label.

    * Mostly FIXED - Can't usefully double-click / right-click on
      most rulers.  This would be useful for a slower but clearer
      way to set loops; adding and editing markers; etc.  Setting
      loops is particularly opaque especially in notation and
      matrix views.

    * Hideous inconsistency (documented in an RFE already) between
      having to use RG for MIDI routing and being unable to use RG
      for audio routing.

    Troubleshooting
    ===============

    Shall we have a troubleshooting section?

    * I'm not seeing any MIDI outputs
    * I'm not hearing any sound from my MIDI outputs
    * I'm not seeing any audio outputs
    * I'm not hearing any sound from my audio outputs
    * I don't see any synth plugins

-->

<!--
    Still to do (yeah right, in 30 to 75 years)
    ===========

    * Control rulers

    * Controller editing

    * Event list

    * Event editor dialogs

    * Document properties

    * Add images for the tools (move, split &c) when describing them

    * Add images for transport buttons in transport section

    * Update notation menu references

    * Add new notation stuff     <- "new" when this to-do item was added? when was that I wonder?

    * Config dialog

    * Make sure the guimenuitem etc tags are being used for all menu refs

    * Give keyboard shortcuts for menu functions?

    * Go through again changing Rosegarden -> &rosegarden; and double-hyphen ->
      &ndash; or &mdash; and review any uses of "the ... function" to see
      if these words are redundant

    * Troubleshooter

    * Check !!! items

    * Fill gaps in revision history

    * Consistent capitalisation: Instrument Parameter Box or instrument
      parameter box?  Audio Mixer or audio mixer?  Device or device?

    * Finally, review the structure again and adjust the <chapter>/<sect*>
      for balance

      <title>About Rosegarden</title>
    <para>
      <application>Rosegarden</application> is a &MIDI; and audio
      sequencer and musical notation editor.  Rosegarden allows you to
      record, arrange, and compose music, in the shape of traditional
      score or &MIDI; data, or of audio files either imported or
      recorded from a microphone, guitar or whatever audio source you
      care to specify.  You can use Rosegarden to write, edit, and
      organise music to create a composition, which you can then
      synthesise, add effects to, and mix down for burning to CD or
      distribution on the web.  Rosegarden also contains professional
      notation editing support for high quality printed output.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Rosegarden</application> is designed to look and
      act in a manner familiar to experienced users coming to Linux
      from other platforms, whilst also being accessible and friendly
      to users new to music software generally.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="intro-handbook">
      <title>About this Handbook</title>
    <para>
    This handbook summarises the capabilities of &rosegarden; and
    provides a reference for some of the concepts involved.  It's
    designed to make sense either read in order or used as a reference
    to the concepts and functions available in Rosegarden.  If you
    would like to read a tutorial as well, <ulink
    url="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/en/chapter-0.html">you
    can find one here</ulink>.</para>

    mailing list instructions.
    </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="intro-menufunctions">
      <title>About Menus and Shortcuts</title> <para>This handbook
      usually refers to the functions you can use in Rosegarden by
      describing where they live on the menus.  For example, the
      function to add a single new track to the main track editor is
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu lang="en">Tracks</guimenu>
	  <guimenuitem>Add Track</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>.</para>

      <para>In many cases, this is not the only way to reach a
      particular function.  In this case the same function is also
      available through the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T, and it also
      appears as an icon on one of the main window's toolbars.  Both
      the keyboard shortcut and the icon can quickly be learned,
      because they are shown on the menu in Rosegarden alongside the
      name of the function.  You should bear in mind that although we
      always give the full menu location in this documentation for
      reference purposes, it's not necessarily the best or most usual
      way to use a function, and you should keep an eye on the
      keyboard shortcuts or toolbar icons as well.

    <sect2 id="intro-optional">
      <title>Optional Features</title> <para>This Handbook assumes
      that your Rosegarden installation supports all the features of
      which it is capable.  Some of Rosegarden's features, including
      some very major ones, are actually optional when building a
      Rosegarden installation, depending on which other libraries and
      supporting code is available.  For example, the whole audio
      subsystem is only compiled in if JACK libraries are available;
      synth plugin support depends on a number of other modules;
      etc.</para> <para>These dependencies are documented in the
      Rosegarden README and configuration documentation. If you find

  <chapter id="file-operations">
    <title>Rosegarden Files and Documents</title>
    <para>
      &rosegarden; stores each composition in its own document, using
      its own internal format.  When you save a document it is stored
      on disc as a file with the .rg extension.<footnote><para>
	 Many users have complained about our opaque binary file
	 format.  It is, in fact, nothing more than gzipped XML.
     </para></footnote>  &rosegarden; can also
      handle a number of other standard file formats.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="file-creating">
      <title>New compositions</title>
      <para>
	When &rosegarden; starts up, it does so with a new document,
	containing an "empty" composition ready to start editing.
	To put something in that composition, you must either record
	something, or create some blank lengths of music (referred
	to as "segments") that you can then fill in using the
	various editing facilities.
      </para>
      <para>See <link linkend="recording">Recording</link> for details of how to record music, and see the <link
	  linkend="segment-view">Track Editor</link> section for a
	description of how to create, edit, and manage segments of
	music.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="file-midi">
      <title>Using MIDI files</title>
      <para>
	To import and export MIDI files, use the 
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu lang="en">File</guimenu>
	  <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem>
	  <guimenuitem>Import MIDI File</guimenuitem>

	functions.
      </para>
      <para>
	Although &rosegarden; can load and save file formats such as
	MIDI, it does not store MIDI data internally.  You should
	generally prefer to save files in &rosegarden;'s own format,
	as &rosegarden; stores quite a lot of information that will
	be lost when exporting to MIDI.  This also applies if you merely
	import a file, and then immediately export it back out.  &rosegarden;
	translates the raw MIDI to its internal format, and then translates that format
	back into MIDI.  Some details of the file structure can and do get
	lost or rearranged in this translation, but the resulting performances
	should be functionally identical.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a MIDI file is loaded, &rosegarden; splits out the
	music into one track per MIDI track or channel in the file,
	<link linkend="studio-midi-import">sets up the appropriate
	  instrument mappings</link>, and <link

      <title>Rosegarden Project files</title> <para>A Rosegarden

      for your composition, as well as other data such as MIDI
      controller settings, plugin details, and the names of any audio
      files referred to in your composition.  The audio files
      themselves are not stored in the Rosegarden composition file;
      instead you are expected to keep track of their location on disk
      yourself (see <link linkend="segment-view-audio-segments">Audio
      segments</link>).  When you need to transfer a project from one
      computer to another, or to a friend or colleague, this can be
      inconvenient.  This is where Rosegarden Project files are
      useful.  A Project file contains your composition, all of the
      audio files it uses, any further data files required for plugins
      used in the composition, and any additional files you may want
      to include, all in one big bundle.</para>

      <para>
	To create an empty segment, in order to begin composing
	something new, you need to use the pencil tool (which is normally the
	default active tool when you first start &rosegarden;).  Click on
	the pencil on the toolbar, and then click at the point where
	you want the segment to start (at the correct height for the
	track you want the segment to be on, and at a distance
	across the editor window corresponding to the correct time)
	and drag rightwards until the segment is the right number of
	bars long.
      </para>
      <para>If you want to draw a segment longer than the visible
	portion of the canvas, the canvas will scroll automatically once you
	reach its edge.  If you keep dragging past the end of the entire
	composition, you can keep dragging, and will push the end marker right along
	with you.  (This is a welcome contrast to earlier version of
	&rosegarden;.)
      </para>

      <para>
	Usually each new segment starts on a barline and extends bar
	by bar, but this snap-to-grid effect can be prevented by
	holding down Shift while clicking and dragging.

	If you are intending to <link

          its played speed without altering its pitch (as would happen
          if the audio was simply played back faster or slower).
          Time-stretching usually adds some audible artifacts as well,

          each rescale.  You can rescale both mono and stereo audio.

          results with stable harmonic sounds such as pads and basses
          as well as purely percussive sounds such as drum loops, but

	  single stream of "tempo changes" and "time signature
	  changes", which you can edit to adjust the tempo and the
	  number and structure of beats in each bar.</para>

	<para>A tempo change
	  can be to a constant fixed tempo, or it can be "ramped"
	  &mdash; changing smoothly to a different target tempo at a
	  given future time.  Each tempo change takes effect until the
	  following one is reached, so any two consecutive tempo changes
	  together describe a region that will be played at a constant
	  or smoothly ramping tempo.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Tempo and time signature are related, because &rosegarden;
	  displays tempo in beats per minute, and the duration of a
	  beat depends on the time signature.  &rosegarden; only
	  permits a single time signature to be in effect in any given
	  bar (that is, you can't have different time signatures in
	  different tracks).  Each new time signature causes a new bar
	  to start, so you can place two time signatures closer
	  together than the natural bar duration in order to obtain a
	  partial bar.

      <title>Devices, instruments and connections</title>

      <para>Rosegarden uses the term Studio to refer to everything it
      knows about the sound systems attached to the computer.  This
      may include &MIDI; and audio hardware and other sound software,
      and includes information about connections, configuration,
      &MIDI; patches and so on.  The Studio is built-in to every
      composition you create with Rosegarden.</para>

      <para>Three pieces of terminology are essential here:

	<variablelist>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Device</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>A <quote>device</quote>, as far as Rosegarden is
	      concerned, is simply something capable of producing
	      sounds.  This may be a MIDI or audio device.  MIDI
	      devices do not necessarily correspond directly to
	      physical MIDI ports: they are just things with names
	      that you can refer to, expected to work in particular
	      ways.  Configuration information such as MIDI patch maps
	      can be attached to devices.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Instrument</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Each device has a number of
		<quote>instruments</quote>, each of which is assumed
		to make a particular sound.  These are the things that
		you can assign tracks to in order to choose which
		sound they play.  By default, a device contains 16
		instruments, created for you at startup: if the device
		is a MIDI device, then these will each be initialised
		to one of the 16 MIDI channels.  The instrument is
		where you set all the properties of a particular
		voice, such as program settings, reverb, volume etc.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Connection</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>While a MIDI device is simply a name and a
	      collection of configuration information, the
	      <quote>connection</quote> specifies which MIDI port it
	      is physically attached to.  This can be configured in
	      the <link linkend="studio-device-editor">MIDI device
	      manager</link>.  (Audio and synth plugin devices do not
	      have connections in the same way.)
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
      </para>

      <para>For example, imagine a setup consisting of a PC with two
	physical MIDI ports, one of which has an external synth
	attached to it.  Here you would normally configure Rosegarden
	so as to have one MIDI device, corresponding to the synth.
	You could then configure this device with the correct name and
	patch map, and then specify a connection for it that
	corresponded to the relevant MIDI port on your soundcard.
	Each of the 16 default instruments on the device could then be
	configured with a suitable program, and you would then assign
	tracks to those.</para>

      <para>
	In practice, Rosegarden will by default create a device for
	each of the available connections on startup.  So in the
	example above, two MIDI devices will be created by default
	even though you only need one.  You would generally then
	rename and apply patch maps to the first, and delete or
	simply not use the second.  Remember that there is no way
	for Rosegarden to know what synths you actually have plugged
	in to the MIDI ports on your computer: for this reason, the
	devices created at startup are just intended to be a default
	set, and it's up to you to ensure that the devices you
	configure match those you are really using.
      </para>

      <para>Once configured, the studio setup is stored with every
	Rosegarden-format file you save.</para>

      <para>
	Remember that each MIDI device contains a number of
	instruments, and that you can assign tracks to those
	instruments.  In MIDI terms, each instrument corresponds to
	a single channel on your MIDI synth.  You can choose which
	of the available voices (sounds) on your synth each
	instrument uses, but in order to do this, you need to let
	Rosegarden know the names for all of the available voices.
      </para>

      <para>
	This dialog allows you to attach banks of programs (names for
	voices) to your MIDI devices, thus permitting each
	instrument on a device to be set to use one of those voices
	in the <link
	  linkend="segment-view-instrumentparameterbox">Instrument
	  Parameter Box</link>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The usual way to set up the program names for a device is
	simply to import them from one of the supplied device
	(".rgd") files.  To do this, select a device in the list on
	the left of the dialog, then click the Import button below
	the list and choose the .rgd file corresponding to your
	synth.
      </para>

      <para>
        If there is no current .rgd file available for your synth,
        then you can use this dialog to create a new bank.  To do this
        you will have to find the program map in your synth's MIDI
        Implementation Chart and enter all the names by hand: you can
        then Export them to a .rgd file to share with other Rosegarden
        users.  Contact the rosegarden-user mailing list if you have
        made a new .rgd file and would like to share it.  (This is how
        all of the existing .rgd files have come to be included with
        Rosegarden: other users have contributed them.)
      </para>

      <sect2 id="studio-keymappings">
	<title>Percussion Key Mappings</title>

	<para>
	  Many MIDI synthesizers have at least one percussion program,
	  in which each "pitch" plays a different type of sound.
	  Rosegarden contains a dedicated percussion matrix editor to
	  view and edit notes against a scale consisting of the
	  correct names for the pitches, instead of against the
	  conventional piano keyboard pitch scale.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The key mappings available for a particular MIDI device are
	  also defined in the Rosegarden device (".rgd") file.  Each
	  MIDI program that is defined as a percussion program can
	  have a key mapping associated with it; if there is one, then
	  it will be used by default in any track that is assigned to
	  this program.  Like program and bank definitions, key
	  mappings can be imported from and exported to .rgd files.

      <sect2 id="studio-soundfonts">
	<title>SoundFonts</title>

	<para>
	  If you happen to be using a soft-synth or soundcard synth
	  that uses SoundFont (.sf2) files, you can simply load the
	  correct program names directly from your .sf2 file into this
	  dialog.  Just ask to Import as normal, and then choose the
	  .sf2 file that you are using instead of a .rgd file.
	</para>

	<para>Note that the Studio only manages information about
	  existing MIDI devices for Rosegarden, it does not actually
	  handle tasks such as loading a SoundFont to your soundcard in
	  the first place.  If you want to make sure a SoundFont is
	  loaded to your soundcard when Rosegarden starts up, you should
	  use the special "Load SoundFont to SoundBlaster card at

      <sect2 id="studio-variations">
	<title>Variations</title>

	<para>
	  Some MIDI devices (for example, those from Roland)
	  organise their program names using a scheme known as
	  "variations".  For these devices, you generally want to
	  select a program by first selecting the basic program name
	  &mdash; such as a piano &mdash; and then selecting one
	  of a set of variations on that program &mdash; such as an
	  electric piano.  This is in contrast to General MIDI-based
	  synths, which organise their programs into banks and
	  expect you to choose a bank first and then a program from
	  that bank.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Rosegarden can support devices that use variations, but
	  you still have to enter the program names in a bank
	  format.  Internally, devices that use variations still use
	  MIDI bank select controllers to choose between the
	  variations; you need to find out from your synth's
	  documentation whether your device uses the LSB or MSB bank
	  select to choose variations, and which bank number
	  corresponds to which variation.  You can then enter the
	  banks as normal, and use the "Show Variation list based on
	  MSB/LSB" option on the bank dialog to tell Rosegarden to
	  show variations instead of banks when displaying that
	  device in an instrument parameter box.
	</para>
      </sect2>

    <sect2 id="studio-midi-import">
      <title>Program mapping on &MIDI; import</title>
      <para>
	
	When you import a &MIDI; file into a composition, &rosegarden;
	uses the existing studio setup to determine how to map the
	&MIDI; programs onto &rosegarden; instruments.  The aim is to
	ensure that every &MIDI; program gets mapped to an instrument
	that really exists in your studio (and thus is actually
	attached to your computer), so that all the &MIDI; tracks
	can be heard.

      </para><para>

	The &MIDI; program-change and bank-select events found in the
	imported file are used when importing, but only as an aid to
	help find the appropriate instrument for each &MIDI; track
	from the set of instruments in your studio.  So, for
	example, if your studio is currently set up to contain only
	<acronym>GM</acronym> instruments, and you import a &MIDI; file with <acronym>GS</acronym> program
	changes onto it, &rosegarden; will remap the <acronym>GS</acronym> banks back
	onto <acronym>GM</acronym> because they're all it knows that you have at the
	time you import the file.  It doesn't remember the original
	<acronym>GS</acronym> program numbers.

      </para><para>

	This means that you should always ensure that your studio is
	correctly configured for the devices you actually have,
	before you import the &MIDI; file.  Otherwise the program data
	in the &MIDI; file may be lost.

    <sect1 id="studio-audio-routing">
      <title>Audio Routing</title>
      <para>
	Any Rosegarden track assigned to an audio or synth plugin
	instrument becomes part of Rosegarden's audio routing
	architecture.  There are 16 audio instruments and 16 synth
	plugin instruments, and each of these has a set of adjustable
	parameters including fader level, pan, effects and so on.
	These are generally configurable in the <link
	linkend="segment-view-instrumentparameterbox">Instrument
	Parameter Box</link> or <link
	linkend="studio-audio-mixer">audio mixer</link>.  Each audio
	instrument also has an input connection, and both audio and
	synth plugin instruments have an output connection.
      </para>
      
      <para>An instrument's input connection defines where Rosegarden
      will read audio data from when recording to this instrument.
      The most usual setting would be to one of Rosegarden's external
      audio inputs, the number of which is configurable in the <link
      linkend="studio-audio-mixer">audio mixer</link>.  These
      correspond to JACK audio ports exposed by Rosegarden, to which
      you can connect outputs from any other JACK audio application or
      soundcard capture ports using an external JACK router
      application such as <ulink
      url="http://qjackctl.sf.net/">QJackCtl</ulink>.  You can also
      set an instrument's audio input to the output of one of
      Rosegarden's built-in audio submasters or master output for
      mixdowns.
      </para>
      <para>An instrument's output connection defines where the audio
      goes when played.  Instruments default to sending their audio to
      Rosegarden's master output, which is another (stereo pair of)
      external JACK port(s) that can then be connected up using the
      same external JACK router.  However, Rosegarden also supports up
      to eight internal submaster busses, to which you can send
      instrument outputs instead so as to group instruments into
      related categories.  You can control the number and routing of

      <title>Audio Plugins</title>
      <para>An audio plugin is a piece of software, separate from
      Rosegarden, that Rosegarden can load and use in order to perform
      a particular audio processing task.  These can be broadly
      divided into effects plugins and synth plugins.  Effects plugins
      take an audio input and manipulate it to produce a different
      audio output; synth plugins take MIDI-like events as input and
      turn them into audio output.  Rosegarden uses the Linux standard
      LADSPA plugin API for effects and the DSSI plugin API for
      synths, permitting the use of large numbers of open-source
      plugins made available by many developers.
      </para>
      <para>The use of plugins has a cost in CPU time, as audio
      processing in real time usually takes a significant amount of
      work even on a modern CPU. It also has a potential cost in
      reliability: when Rosegarden is running a plugin, if the plugin
      hangs or crashes, so does Rosegarden.  Many plugins are very
      reliable, but it's inevitable that some will not be so well
      tested.

    <title>Quantization</title>
    <para>
      "Quantization" is the process of repositioning notes and other
      events so that they start or finish on exact beat divisions.  It
      is traditionally used to make an approximate performance into a
      precise but rather mechanical-sounding one -- either because
      precision is the desired effect, or for reasons such as making
      the notes clearer in notation.
    </para>

    <para>
      For general quantization, use
      	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu lang="en">Segments</guimenu>

	  <guimenu lang="en">Adjust</guimenu>

      you can select the precise quantization parameters you need, and
      then it applies these to all of the selected segments or notes.

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Grid quantizer</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The grid quantizer moves the start times of notes so
	  that they start at the nearest point on some grid (defined
	  by various parameters of the quantizer).  Thus notes that
	  initially vary slightly in start time will be aligned by the

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Legato quantizer</term>

	  remove any gaps between notes by extending each note so as
	  to (at least) continue until the start of the following one.

	  None (the default), quantization will be to an even grid
	  spaced according to the base grid unit.</para>
	  <para>If set to 100%,
	  every second grid line will be placed two-thirds of the distance
	  between the previous and next ones, instead of only half.
	  This will result in notes being quantized to the first and
	  third triplets of a swing beat.
	  </para>
	  <para>Other settings will produce proportionately varying degrees of

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Iterative amount</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The default behaviour of the grid quantizer is to move
	  each note exactly onto its nearest grid line.  But if you
	  set the iterative amount to something less than 100% (the
	  "Full quantize" default), each note will only be moved that
	  percentage of the distance toward its nearest grid line,
	  resulting in a nearly-but-not-quite quantized effect.</para>
	  <para>This quantizer may be applied repeatedly so as to try
	  out gradually increasing degrees of quantization, hence the
	  name "iterative".  Use 
	<menuchoice>

	  <guimenuitem>Quantize</guimenuitem>
	  <guimenuitem>Repeat Last Quantize</guimenuitem>

      on the <link linkend="segment-view-segmentparameterbox">Segment

      </para>
      <para>The Grid menu controls the size of the visible grid in the
      background of the matrix view, as well as the time resolution
      used when entering and moving notes.  After you set it to a
      particular time value, the normal note insertion and drag
      operations will then snap automatically to grid points spaced at
      that time width.  You can override the snap-to-grid effect
      temporarily by holding down Shift during editing, or you can
      disable it by setting the Grid menu to None.
      </para>
      <para>The Quantize menu works rather differently.  Rather than
      controlling the behaviour of other editing tools, it actually
      performs an action.  When you change the value in this menu, the
      selected notes -- or the whole segment if nothing is selected
      -- will immediately be quantized using a grid quantizer of the
      chosen resolution.
      </para>
      <para>The Quantize menu also shows you continuously what
      resolution the current segment or selection is quantized to.
      For example, if you select a set of notes that start on
      consecutive quarter-note beats, the Quantize menu will update
      itself to show 1/4, as this is the coarsest resolution
      consistent with the existing quantization of the current

      <title>Single and multiple staffs</title>

      <para>
	There are three ways to open a notation editor from the
	&rosegarden; main window.  (They all require that you
	have some existing segments in the main window first,
	so if you're starting a new composition, you should
	create your segments before you start thinking about

	    <listitem>
	      
	      <para>The most obvious way is just to double-click on
		a segment in the main canvas.  This opens the segment
		in whatever you have configured <!-- !!!Link --> as
		the default editor (notation, matrix, or event list),
		and by default this is the notation editor.  So
		double-clicking a single segment will open it as a
		single staff in a Notation editor window.</para>
	      
	      <para>You can also open a multi-staff editor this way:
		holding down the Shift key, select (with a single

    <!-- Linear and page layouts -->

    <sect1 id="nv-layout">
      <title>Linear and page layouts</title>

      <para>
	The usual way the notation editor displays staffs is known
	as Linear layout: one staff on top of another, with each
	staff as a single, horizontally scrollable long line.  Some
	of the functions of the editor (such as the <link
	  linkend="nv-rulers">Rulers</link>) are only available in
	Linear layout.
      </para>

      <para>
	However, you can also display staffs in two different
	page-based layouts: Continuous Page and Multiple Page.</para>

      <para>In Continuous Page layout, the music is arranged in one
	infinitely-tall page of the same width as the window.  Each
	staff breaks at the end of a line, starting a new line below
	the remaining staffs.</para>

      <para>In Multiple Page layout, the music is divided up into
	real pages much as it will be when printed.  The size of each
	page is calculated so that approximately the same amount of
	music will fit on each line as it will when actually printed
	(according to the point size specified for the printing
	resolution in the configuration dialog).  The printed version
	is unlikely to be exactly the same, as it depends on the
	precise paper size and margins in use when printing, but it
	should be fairly close if you happen to be using A4
	paper.</para>

	The &rosegarden; Notation editor window includes two graduated rulers,

	lines shown initially at the start of the top staff in the

	The blue cursor is the playback pointer.  Just like the

	  In Notation view menu there are two functions which can be
	  used to transpose notes by an arbitrary interval, namely
	    <menuchoice>
	      <guimenu lang="en">Adjust</guimenu>
	      <guimenuitem>Transpose</guimenuitem>
	      <guimenuitem>Transpose by Semitones</guimenuitem>
	    </menuchoice>
	  function which asks just the number of semitones to be
	  transposed, and
	    <menuchoice>
	      <guimenu lang="en">Adjust</guimenu>
	      <guimenuitem>Transpose</guimenuitem>
	      <guimenuitem>Transpose by Interval</guimenuitem>
	    </menuchoice>
	  function which shows a neat dialog that can be used to 
	  transpose notes. In the latter, the dialog shows an example 
	  notes before and after transposing and expresses the
	  interval in written form. The interval may be changed either
	  by dragging the notes shown by the dialog or by changing
	  separately the base note, its octavation and accidentals.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In Segment view, Notation view, and Track view there is also

	      <guimenu lang="en">Segment(s)</guimenu>
	      <guimenuitem>Transpose by Interval</guimenuitem>
	    </menuchoice>
	  function which makes a transpose to entire segment. In this
	  dialog you may also choose whether only the notes are
	  transposed or the keys of the segment are transposed also.

      <para>To insert a note, select one of the note tools by clicking

      </para>

      <para>You can also select one of the accidentals on the toolbar
      to insert sharpened or flattened notes.  If no accidental is
      selected, the note inserted will follow the key signature.
      Alternatively, you can select the "Follow previous accidental"
      icon (shown as a note with an arrow pointing back from where the
      accidental would appear) to make the note follow whatever
      accidental was last used at the same height on the staff.</para>

      <para>If you add a note at the same time as an existing note of
	different duration, the editor will generally assume that you
	want to create chords and will split the existing or new note
	accordingly so as to create one or more chords with ties.  If
	you really do want to chord two different durations, you can
	select the tied noteheads and use the Collapse Equal-Pitch Notes
	function to merge them together. Alternatively, the default
	behaviour can be changed in the &rosegarden; configuration dialog
	so as not to do the split at all.</para>

      <para>If you add a note exactly over an existing note of
	different duration (i.e. at the same pitch), the duration of the
	existing note will be changed to that of the new one.</para>

      <para>If you add a rest at the same time as an existing note,
	the note will be silenced for the duration of the rest,
	shortening or possibly removing it altogether.</para>

	  <title>Duration</title>

	  <para>First, ensure a notation tool is selected to indicate
	    the duration of note (or rest) you wish to insert.  You can
	    select the various note types using the number keys:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>

	  <para>You can switch to a triplet version of the note
	    duration by pressing the <keycap>G</keycap> key.  Pressing it
	    again will switch back to the normal duration.  The status
	    bar at the bottom of the window will notify you of when a
	    triplet duration is active.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Pitch</title>

	  <para>Once a notation tool is selected, you can insert a
	    note at the current position of the <link
	      linkend="nv-rulers">insert cursor</link> by pressing one of
	    the pitch keys:</para>

	  <para>Holding <keycap>Shift</keycap> while pressing a key

	  <para>To enter notes an octave higher, use the corresponding

	    <keycap>W</keycap>, <keycap>E</keycap>, <keycap>R</keycap>,
	    <keycap>U</keycap>, <keycap>I</keycap>, and

	<sect3>
	  <title>Rests</title>
	  
	  <para>To insert a rest instead of a note, press
	    <keycap>P</keycap>.  Alternatively, you can use the

	    current tool to a rest tool and back to a note tool again.</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Chords</title>

	  <para>The default behaviour of the notation editor is to
	    move the insert cursor forward after inserting a note, so as
	    to be ready to insert another note after it in a melody;
	    this can be changed using the <keycap>H</keycap> key, which
	    switches to chord mode so that subsequent insertions occur
	    at the same time as the last one.  Pressing
	    <keycap>H</keycap> again switches back to the melody
	    insertion behaviour.</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Changing note durations</title>

	  <para>You can use the keyboard to change the durations of
	  notes that you've already entered.  Make sure the notes you
	  want to change are selected, and then press
	  <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> plus the number key for the note you
	  want.  You can also add or remove dots, by pressing
	  <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> plus "." &mdash; use this repeatedly to
	  select between one dot, two dots and no dots.</para>

	  <para>If you also hold <keycap>Alt</keycap> as well as
	  <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>, you will change the durations of the
	  notes as displayed in the notation editor without changing
	  their performed durations.  This can be very useful for
	  tidying up a score: see also <link
	  linkend="nv-quantization">notation from performance
	  data</link>.
	  </para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Other remarks</title>

	  <para>All of the insertion commands are also available on a
	    submenu of the Tools menu.  It's unlikely you'd ever want to
	    navigate the menus just to insert a single note, but the
	    menus show the keyboard shortcuts and so provide a useful
	    reference in case you forget which key is which.</para>

	  <para>The keyboard shortcuts are currently designed for use
	    with a QWERTY-layout keyboard.  There is not yet any way to
	    remap the keys for another layout, short of reassigning each
	    key individually using the "Configure Shortcuts..." option
	    on the Settings menu.</para>

	  <para>Holding the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key while pressing a
	    number will select the corresponding dotted-note

      <sect2 id="nv-insertion-midi">
	<title>Entering notes using a MIDI keyboard</title>

	<para>
	  You can enter notes into the notation editor one at a time
	  using a MIDI keyboard or other MIDI control device &mdash; a
	  process known as step recording.  The notation editor uses
	  the pitches you play on the keyboard, but the durations you
	  have selected in the editor itself.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To start entering notes from a MIDI keyboard, first make
	  sure the keyboard is configured as your default MIDI
	  record device.  Then make sure a notation tool is selected
	  to set a duration.  Then press the <!-- !!!  image of
	  button --> step recording button on the notation editor's
	  toolbar, or select Step Recording from the Tools menu.
	  From that point on all notes pressed on the MIDI keyboard
	  will be inserted at the current insertion time in that
	  notation window, until step recording is switched off
	  again or activated in a different window or the window is
	  closed.
	</para>

	<para>
	  You can select another notation tool while step recording
	  is in progress, in order to insert notes of different
	  durations; and you can also switch into Chord mode <!--

      <title>Clef and key</title>

<!-- !!! rework -->      
      <para>The first thing to know about the way &rosegarden; handles
	these is that time-related changes (tempos and time
	signatures) are treated entirely differently from clefs and
	keys. In order to simplify managing playback and recording as
	well as notation, &rosegarden; requires that when the tempo or
	time signature changes, it does so in all staffs at once.  You
	can't have one staff in 2/4 and another in 6/8 simultaneously,
	or one staff playing at 120 to the beat and another at 90.
	This applies only to time: there is no such restriction on the
	use of clef and key changes.  See also <link linkend="tempo">Tempo in Rosegarden</link>.</para>

      <para>To change the clef, key, tempo or time signature within a
      notation editor window, position the <link
      linkend="nv-rulers">insert cursor</link> at the point where you
      want the change to happen, and use one of the Edit menu's Add
      Clef Change..., Add Key Change..., Add Tempo Change... and Add
      Time Signature Change... functions.  You will then see a dialog
      box in which you can choose the particular clef, key, tempo or
      time signature setting you want to apply, as follows.</para>

		  For example, inserting a

	  (at least one space: the editor doesn't care about any extra
	  whitespace). Each syllable in turn will be attached to the
	  next subsequent note or chord within that bar (although at
	  the moment the editor can get quite confused by chords that
	  are not exact, i.e. that require smoothing or
	  quantizing).</para>

	<para>If you want a note to have no syllable attached to it,
	  you need to provide a dot (".") as the syllable for that
	  note.  (This is why the default lyric text for a segment is
	  usually full of dots.)  Remember to separate the dots with
	  spaces, so that they are clearly separate syllables.</para>
	
	<para>If you want more than one syllable on the same note,
	  with a space between them, use a tilde ("~") instead of the
	  space.  It will be shown as a space on the score.</para>

	<para>If you want to split a syllable across two notes, with
	  a hyphen, you need to enter a space following the hyphen so
	  the editor knows to treat it as two syllables.  (Hyphens get
	  no special treatment within syllables.)</para>

	<para>Syllables consisting only of numbers surrounded by
	  square brackets (like "[29]") will be ignored; this is the
	  format used for the automatically-generated bar numbers
	  shown in the editor.</para>

	<para>You should also be aware that the textual format of
	  lyrics is only used for editing:  the lyrics are actually
	  stored as distinct text events (one per syllable).  This
	  means that the text format may potentially change in the
	  future to accommodate more advanced editing capabilities,
	  although the event format should not change and so your
	  saved files should continue to be compatible.</para>

	<para>&rosegarden; supports also multiple lines of lyrics.
	  You may always attach one more verse into a single staff
	  by clicking Add Verse in the lyrics editor.  All the verses
	  are entered with the same syntax.  If you leave the last verse
	  without syllables,  or make it empty,  it is removed from
	  the list of verses next time you open the lyrics editor.

      <title>Guitar Chords</title>

      <para>
      	Like text, it is possible to add guitar chord diagrams to a
      	notation track (or to edit previously added ones). This is
      	done by toggling the
      	<guimenuitem>Guitar Chord</guimenuitem>
      	button, and then clicking on the same area as for adding text.
      	This will open the Guitar Chord dialog. With it you can select
      	which guitar chord diagram you want to add from a chord
      	dictionary which comprises most of the common chord fingerings
      	by specifying a chord's root and its extension. For
      	convenience, the fingerings are sorted in three different
      	categories :
      	<guimenuitem>beginner</guimenuitem>
      	,
      	<guimenuitem>common</guimenuitem>
      	and
      	<guimenuitem>all</guimenuitem>
      	. These categories are actually based on the chord extension
      	(A7 is a beginner chord, while A13 isn't), not on the
      	fingering itself, so you can still see "advanced" chord
      	fingerings listed, even in beginner mode.
      </para>

      <para>
      	It is also possible to add your own fingerings if needed. To
      	do this, click on the 'New' button. This will pop up a chord
      	editor, where you can "draw" which fingering you want to add,
      	and specify its root, chord extension, and starting fret
      	number.

      	Note that while you can choose the extension from a list of
      	predefined values, you can also type whatever value you want.
      	However, in that case, the new fingering will only be
      	available in the 'all' list. Also, you can only delete and
      	edit your own chords. Those from the predefined dictionary
      	cannot be changed. If you spot a mistake in one of them,

      <title>Slurs and hairpins</title>

      <para>Slur and hairpin (crescendo/decrescendo) dynamic markings are stored as events,

	want it to cover (a series of notes or whatever), and then use

	<guimenuitem>Add Crescendo</guimenuitem> or 
	<guimenuitem>Add Decrescendo</guimenuitem> options from

     <para>Placement of hairpins can be somewhat tricky, and this is
	 especially so with haripins that run in line with dynamic markings.
	 It is commonly the case that a hairpin that doesn't quite look right
	 in &rosegarden;'s own notation editor will nevertheless come out just
	 fine once exported to LilyPond.  &rosegarden;'s slurs generally come
	 out best when all the stems are running in the same direction, and
	 occasionally need to be <link
	     linkend="nv-microposition">repositioned</link> by hand to achieve
	 better placement.  Slurs also tend to fare slightly better once
	 exported to LilyPond.
     </para>

      <para>You remove a slur or hairpin in the same way as any
	other event: either select it with the selection tool and then
	hit <keycap>Delete</keycap>, or click on it with the erase tool active.</para>

    <!-- Stem direction, slashes etc -->

    <sect1 id="nv-note-qualities">

      <para>You can set the stem direction of any selected notes
	(provided they are a sort that have stems) using the three
	Stem Direction options on the Notes menu.  The options allow
	you to either fix the stems up or down, or revert to the stem

	also <link linkend="nv-beamed-groups">Beams</link>.</para>

      <para>The <guimenu>Note</guimenu> menu also contains options for adding slashes
	across note stems, for example to indicate short repeated
	notes or drum rolls.  These are currently purely notational;
	&rosegarden; will not take them into account when playing the
	staff or generating &MIDI;.</para>

    <!-- Beamed groups, including overlapping and nesting them -->

    <sect1 id="nv-beamed-groups">
      <title>Beams</title>
      
      <para>Adding beams to notes is considered a grouping operation
	in the &rosegarden; Notation editor, available on the <guimenu>Phrase</guimenu>
	menu.  Select the notes you want to beam, and use the
	<guimenuitem>Beam Group</guimenuitem> menu option.  To remove a beam, select the notes and use
	the <guimenuitem>Unbeam</guimenuitem> menu option.</para>

      <para>It is possible to have more than one beamed group
	happening at the same time &mdash; you just select and beam the
	separate groups one at a time &mdash; but Rosegarden is usually not
	yet clever enough to work out which notes should have stems up
	and which should have stems down for simultaneous beamed
	groups, so you will probably have to set the stem directions
	of the notes in the groups explicitly as well as beaming them.</para>

      <para>&rosegarden; can attempt to guess a sensible beaming for a
	piece of music, provided it's not too complicated.  To invoke
	this, select the notes you want to calculate the beaming for
	(for example by triple-clicking to select a whole staff) and
	then use the <guimenuitem>Auto-Beam</guimenuitem> option on the 
	<guimenu>Phrase</guimenu> menu.  Auto-beaming
	is also done automatically when loading a &MIDI; file, for
	example, and the editor also does some automatic beaming as
	you enter notes (this can be disabled by changing the
	"Auto-Beam when appropriate" setting on the configuration
	dialog or the insertion tool's right-button menu).</para>

    <!-- Tuplets -->

    <sect1 id="nv-tuplets">
      <title>Triplets and other tuplets</title>

      <para>A triplet group consists of three notes or chords played
	in the time of two.  (More precisely, it consists of notes
	with a total duration of three arbitrary units played in the
	time of two of those units.)</para>

      <para>We use the word <quote>tuplet</quote> to describe the general
	situation in which notes with a total duration of any given
	number of units are played in the time of a different number
	of those units: nine notes in the time of eight, or six in the
	time of four, or a crotchet and a quaver in the time of a
	single crotchet, or even two notes in the time of three.  (At
	present &rosegarden; does not support the last example &mdash; tuplet
	groups must always be played with a shorter duration than
	written.)</para>

      <para>The triplet and tuplet menu functions work by taking an
	existing series of notes or rests and squashing them so they
	play quicker, filling in the left-over space at the end of the
	series with a final rest and drawing the whole as a tuplet
	group.  You can therefore create a new series of triplets by
	entering the first two notes of the series (in their normal
	form), making them into triplets, and then filling in the rest
	left over by the triplet operation with the final note of the
	triplet.  Or you can apply the triplet operation before you
	enter any notes, thus turning the original rest itself into
	triplet form, and then insert the notes of the triplet on top
	of it.  Some examples may help:</para>

      <title>Notation from performance data</title>

      <para>
	&rosegarden; is a multi-purpose program: it is a notation
	editor, but it is primarily a sequencer and editor for
	performed music.  And in performance, of course, the times
	and durations of notes are rarely as precise as they are on
	a printed score.
      </para>

      <para>
	This means that it's often desirable for &rosegarden; to do
	a lot of tidying of the basic note times and durations when
	attempting to make meaningful notes to show in the notation
	editor.  This is a kind of quantization, but a kind that
	requires a surprising amount of guesswork to do well.
	&rosegarden; includes a quantizer designed to do a slightly
	better job of this than the plain grid quantizer.
      </para>

      <para>Applying
	quantization strictly for notation is rather unimaginatively
	referred to as <quote>notation quantization</quote>: it only
	applies to the notes you see and edit in notation, and
	doesn't affect the notes that play, or that you edit in
	other views such as the matrix.  This quantization is
	automatically applied to music imported or recorded from
	MIDI, although not all of its possible capabilities are
	enabled by default.
      </para>

      <para>
	There are two ways to see which notes have been quantized
	for notation.  By default, each notation view contains a <link
	    linkend="nv-raw-note-ruler">raw
	    note ruler</link> (in the group of rulers above the score) showing
	a rectangular block for each note.  This block is positioned
	so as to represent the time and duration of the note as
	performed, but with the top and bottom edges of the
	rectangle extended or shortened to represent the time after
	notation quantization.  If this is too much information for
	you, you can alternatively choose (in the configuration
	dialog) to show in a green colour all note heads in the
	score that have had their timings altered by notation
	quantization.

	If the quantization &rosegarden; has used is not suitable,

	at all.  To apply a different quantization to some notes,
	select the notes and use the Quantize...
	menu function (tick the box labelled <quote>Quantize for
	  notation only</quote>).  The quantization level or type used
	by default can be changed in the configuration dialog.

		<para>The base grid unit (set to a note duration

		  all notes will be placed on boundaries of a multiple
		  of a semiquaver, with durations also a multiple of a
		  semiquaver.
		</para>
		<para>The setting of the base grid unit is not quite
		  as significant for a notation quantizer as it is for a
		  plain grid quantizer, because all it does is impose an
		  absolute limit on the level of precision permitted by
		  the complexity parameter.  Mostly, when you find a
		  case in which increasing the grid unit produces better
		  results, you've actually found a case in which the

    <sect1 id="developers-note-fonts">
      <title>Configuring custom notation fonts</title>

      <para>If you have a notation font installed on your system in a
	scalable format (TrueType or Type-1) but it is not currently
	supported by Rosegarden, you can create your own mapping XML
	file to describe the font's character map and metrics in a way
	Rosegarden can use.  These files are installed in the
	fonts/mappings subdirectory of the Rosegarden installation
	directory, and a number of samples are included with the
	distribution.</para>

      <para>You can also use these mapping files to define new
	pixmap-based fonts, in which every shape in a particular size is
	loaded from a separate pixmap file.  The two standard notation
	fonts supplied with Rosegarden are pixmap fonts defined in
	exactly this way.
      </para>

      <para>It is even possible to define a notation font as using one
	or more scalable system fonts, augmented with pixmaps for
	particular sizes or for characters not found in the scalable
	fonts.  This is because most of the mapping file format is the
	same for scalable and pixmap fonts, and where there are
	different elements for the different sorts of fonts, it is
	usually possible to include both of them.  Rosegarden will
	usually use pixmaps where available and scalable fonts
	otherwise.
      </para>

      <para>You may also wish to edit the mapping files supplied with
	Rosegarden if you find their measurements for alignment or
	sizing are not to your liking.  (If you believe that any of the
	supplied files are actually wrong, please let us know.)

	  <para>This element must exist in every mapping file, and
	    should contain all the other elements.  The only attribute
	    is "name", which contains the font's name as shown in the
	    font selection dropdown.  Although the file format will
	    permit any name to be used here, Rosegarden will only pick
	    up the font corectly if the XML file has the same name as
	    the contents of this attribute (except that the XML file
	    should be named in lower-case and should end in ".xml").

		<term>copyright</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A textual description of the likely copyright
		    status of the mapped font (not the copyright status
		    of the mapping file).  Note that because the mapping
		    file contains information such as origin and
		    copyright of the font itself, it is usually
		    advisable to make separate mapping files for
		    separate fonts where practical, even if the fonts

		  <para>This information is only intended for the user

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>smooth</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A boolean attribute indicating whether the

		    contain the vertically smallest bounding boxes for
		    elements such as note heads and accents, rather than
		    including empty space above or below these elements
		    for alignment purposes.  Most fonts do not do what
		    Rosegarden expects.  Therefore for these fonts you

	    "font-scale" and "font-size".  Their use depends on the
	    type of font being described.</para>

	  <para>
	    For pixmap (non-scalable) fonts, the "font-sizes" element
	    should contain a list of "font-size" elements, one for
	    each size of pixmaps available.  The pixmaps themselves
	    must be installed in the
	    fonts/&lt;font-name&gt;/&lt;font-size&gt; subdirectory of
	    the Rosegarden installation directory, where
	    &lt;font-name&gt; is the name of the font (as specified in
	    the "rosegarden-font-encoding" element at the start of the
	    mapping file), or a lower-case version of the name, and
	    &lt;font-size&gt; is the pixel size of the font.  A font
	    size will only be made available to the user if it has an
	    entry in the "font-sizes" list and the pixmap directory is
	    found.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	    For scalable fonts, the "font-sizes" element should
	    contain one "font-scale" element that defines the
	    relationships between font and non-font elements in a
	    general way, and also defines the relationship between
	    Rosegarden's nominal font size and the size of the
	    corresponding system font.  If this "font-scale" element
	    is found, then Rosegarden will assume the font is
	    available in any size.  You can however still include one
	    or more "font-size" elements to define precise proportions
	    for any particular size for which the general proportions
	    do not quite work correctly, for example because of
	    rounding error.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The attributes of "font-scale" and "font-size" are very
	    similar.  The main difference is that all attributes of
	    "font-scale" are floating-point values relative to the
	    font size, where 1.0 is the base font size (i.e. the
	    distance between staff lines), whereas attributes of
	    "font-size" are integer pixel values.  The attributes
	    available are as follows.  (Those marked "optional" have
	    vaguely sensible defaults, so it's a good idea to try not
	    setting them first.)

	    This element lists the symbols available in this notation
	    font, and which pixmap files or system font code points
	    they should be drawn from.</para>

	  <para>It should contain a list of "symbol" elements.  These
	    have several possible attributes, the choice of which will

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>name</term>

		    url="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf">Unicode
		    3.2 standard</ulink>, the name should be that used to

		<para>Most of the symbols Rosegarden expects to find

      <para>
	Rosegarden's notation editor has the ability to display and
	edit notes in various standard styles: classical, diamond
	heads and so on.  These styles are all defined in XML style
	definition files installed along with the application, and
	it's possible to create a new one by writing a simple XML
	file.  Rosegarden simply looks at the set of installed files
	to determine which styles to offer the user.  You can refer to
	the default set of files in the styles subdirectory of the
	Rosegarden installation directory for examples.
      </para>

      <para>
	The file format is not yet especially comprehensive; at the
	moment it has been designed to be powerful enough to describe
	the standard styles that come with Rosegarden, but not much
	more.  If you should try to create new styles this way, we'd
	be very interested in your feedback on the Rosegarden
	mailing-lists.

    Unmanaging widgets is the usual method for temporarily
    making them invisible.  They can be re-managed with
    <function>XtManageChildren()</function>.
  </para>
    <para>
    You can unmap a widget, but leave it under geometry
    management by calling <function>XtUnmapWidget()</function>.  You can
    destroy a widget's window without destroying the widget by
    calling <function>XtUnrealizeWidget()</function>.  You can destroy a
    widget completely with <function>XtDestroyWidget()</function>.
  </para>
    <para>
    If you are only going to unmanage a single widget, it is
    more convenient to call <function>XtUnmanageChild()</function>.  It is
    often more convenient to call <function>XtUnmanageChild()</function>
    several times than it is to declare and initialize an array
    of widgets to pass to <function>XtUnmanageChildren()</function>.  Calling
    <function>XtUnmanageChildren()</function> is more efficient, however,
    because it only calls the parent's <function>change_managed()</function>
    method once.

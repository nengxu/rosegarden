Current Task list
======================================

- soundfont load at startup

- implement auto-extend of track editor's canvas when moving a segment
beyond the canvas' boundary.

- harmonize namings of m_view* toggle actions, slotToggleXXX(), slotShowXXX()
 (m_viewSegmentParameters / slotToggleSegmentParameters / slotShowSegmentParameters)

- valgrind/kcachegrind - standby, not working on my P4

- try to improve sequencer latency problems (GUI & seq. should mmap a
tmp file which would hold easy-to-parse event data. File should have
lines of fixed length).

- show selected zones à la RG2.1

- audio peak files in tmp. dir with hashed names

- menu item status (enabled/disabled) - ongoing work...

- better error report when failing to load a resource

- RPM building - taken over by nice volunteers

- look at lazy note pixmap rendering again (see
gui/qcanvassimplesprite.h r1.18, qcanvassimplesprite.cpp r1.20,
notationstaff.cpp r1.146).

- guitar chord display

- AA text on canvas

- use KFilterBase/KFilterDev for accessing .rg files (rather than calling zlib directly)

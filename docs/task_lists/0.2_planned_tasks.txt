Possible features and work for release 0.2
==========================================

Three categories: Work required to finish basic features that are
already started; new features that are suitable for the 0.2 timeframe;
basis work for features that won't appear until later.


Work required to fix existing stuff
-----------------------------------

1.  updating one edit window when something is edited in another
    (however crudely we do it at first).  -- at the moment if you
    delete a note in one window then insert in another, it crashes
    [carried over from 0.1] [DONE -- dead slow though]

2.  better time signature support.  The way things are at the
    moment, if you insert a time sig into a track it gets copied
    into all other tracks (correctly) but if you then move one of
    the tracks they become out of sync again.  Better to store
    time sigs in the Composition's reference track only, and save
    them to file from there.  Probably a good case for having
    notation elements without corresponding events (because the
    time sig event will never be copied to individual tracks).
    This would also require GUI for handling time sigs in track
    editor rather than (just) notation view.  Complicated stuff

3.  leger lines [DONE]

4.  ties (rendering them; they already are stored and handled in
    playback - qcanvasspline is here though) [DONE]

5.  possibly quite a bit of work needed on improving the "feel" of
    insertion, track dragging etc: they currently feel rather
    vague, there's resistance in the GUI, feedback is not good,
    sometimes insertion just doesn't work (e.g. when height is too
    far from that of existing note)

6.  a great many optimisations in layout and particularly in
    relayout after insertion, including some really obvious ones
    like only re-preparsing the one staff you just inserted onto...
    probably some optimisations possible in pixmap generation too
    [some of these optimisations, particularly for insertion,
    actually got DONE in 0.1]

7.  a few fixes to basic note drawing -- sometimes shifts the
    wrong notehead, note's stem sometimes doesn't meet its beam &c
    [some DONE]

8.  mucho cleaning up and tidying in the GUI: toolbars, menus,
    palettes etc.  kind of obvious




New features suitable for 0.2
-----------------------------

1.  selection and cut, copy, paste

2.  dynamics, such as slurs and hairpins

3.  text on the score (and MIDI import and export)

4.  generic event property editor dialog

5.  "internationalisation" of gui?  some nice english note names...

6.  Note velocities.  Internal rep and import/export.  Text to
    velocity conversions?

7.  MIDI recording - also requires basic track selection and Record/Mute
    track buttons.

8.  Transport GUI - play, rwd buttons etc - timer.

9.  Looping.

10. Position pointers in notation client.

11. Track canvas and client that follow playback (playback follow mode).

12. Piano-roll view, but only if someone other than us steps up
    to implement it in parallel with the stuff we're doing?

13. Event editor (possible hyper editor type i/f for velocities)


Basis for later features
------------------------

1.  undo that works at least some of the time

2.  layers (for counterpoint)

3.  some skeletal help

4.  audio tracks support

5.  instruments - assigning them on the GUI and how they map
    through to aRts (basic Environment)

6.  Lilypond output (definitely a higher priority than MusiXTeX
    for this version, and possibly higher than any other printing
    method too)

7.  NIFF I/O?  (It'd be nice to get independent contributors to
    work on Lilypond and NIFF I/O -- although I can imagine doing
    the basic Lilypond stuff myself if need be)

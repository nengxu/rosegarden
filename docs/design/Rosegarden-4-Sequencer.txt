The Sequencer
=============

The Rosegarden-4 sequencer comprises code from two directories in the
rosegarden CVS tree.  There's the code in the rosegarden/sequencer which 
defines the application itself and top level behaviours as well as the
vital DCOP interface it uses to communicate with the Rosegarden main process.
Additionally there is code in two libraries built out of the rosegarden/sound
directory.  These are libRosegardenSequencer and libRosegardenSound.

RosegardenSequencer library
===========================

This holds the sound driver and related code - stuff that the sequencer
alone is interested in.  Conditional compilation occurs according to 
the type of sound support required.  ALSA, JACK and aRts are supported -
ALSA and aRts are mutually exclusive options with JACK an additional
option for the ALSA sequencer.

The ALSA/JACK combination is the preferred and better supported
combination.  The "why" of that is rather a long story.


RosegardenSound library
=======================

Contains MappedComposition and other Mapped definitions (includind
MappedObject and MappedStudio).  Also PeakFile generation and
management code.  WAV/RIFF/BWF file format handling.  MidiFile
handling as well.   This library is required by the main 
Rosegarden process as well as the Sequencer itself.

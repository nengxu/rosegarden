Basic units
===========


Performance pitch
-----------------

Events store pitch values in simple integers.  These are
fixed-frequency pitches in the MIDI pitch scale, independent of clef
and key.  Adding 12 to a pitch increments it by one octave; pitch 60
is the treble-clef middle C.  (Previous rewrites have considered using
double the MIDI pitch so as to allow quarter-tones; this time let's go
for the simpler option as if we ever want quarter-tones we can always
code them using special Event properties.)


Display pitch
-------------

For notation purposes we need a display pitch, which is a composite of
height on the staff plus accidental.  The correspondence between
display pitch and raw pitch depends on the clef and key.  For height
on the staff, we use the RG2.1 convention of 0 = bottom line, 1 = gap
between bottom two lines and so on up to 8 = top line.  Negative
heights are below the staff (i.e. on leger lines), heights over 8 are
above.  Display pitch is therefore independent of clef, so height 0 is
always the bottom line in any clef.

If we ever see pitch as a plain integer, we assume it's a raw internal
pitch rather than a display pitch.  A plain integer used for display
pitch would probably be referred to as a "height" rather than a pitch,
as it would be lacking the extra information (accidental, clef, key)
required to interpret it as a true pitch.


Rosegarden 2.1 pitch
--------------------

Rosegarden 2.1 had a rather peculiar way of storing pitch, which we
support for Rosegarden 2.1 file I/O only.

The pitch recorded in its files is a "height on staff" measurement
which depends on the pitch offset of the clef but not its octave.  For
example, pitch -2 is middle C in the treble clef, but is also a C in
any other clef, although in a different octave.  (If the pitch were a
pure height measurement, -2 would be an E in the bass clef, a D in the
alto and a B in the tenor.)

Accidentals are recorded in absolute form in the file, i.e. as
sounding accidentals independent of the key signature then in force.


Duration
--------

[Note: As of 20020128 CVS builds, the following is no longer true.
Until then, we stored durations at a 96ppq resolution, but that has
now been increased to 960ppq to cope with the demands of precise
placement of audio samples as well as of notes.  The following is
an explanation for our original choice of 96ppq with reference to
notes only.]

Events store duration as simple integers where 6 units = one
hemidemisemiquaver.  Thus also 1 unit = 4 MIDI clocks.  Rationale:

MIDI's tempo-independent unit, the clock, is "1/24th of a quarter
note", i.e. 1/3 of a demisemiquaver.  Rosegarden 2.1 uses a unit of
one hemidemisemiquaver; this is not evenly expressible in MIDI clocks.
Rosegarden 2.1 can also handle dotted hemidemis in some contexts.

We probably need no better than hemidemi resolution (leaving aside
situations involving interesting tuplet grouping); but we want to be
able to represent MIDI clocks and Rosegarden 2.1 hemidemis and dotted
hemidemis without loss, so we will need an effective resolution down
to 1/6 hemidemisemiquaver.

Let's settle on that, then:

           1 unit  = 1/4 clock
           4 units =   1 clock
           6 units = 3/2 clocks = 1 hemidemisemiquaver
          12 units =   3 clocks = 1 demisemiquaver
          24 units =   6 clocks = 1 semiquaver
          48 units =  12 clocks = 1 quaver
          96 units =  24 clocks = 1 crotchet
         192 units =  48 clocks = 1 minim
         384 units =  96 clocks = 1 semibreve
         768 units = 192 clocks = 1 breve

and the longest note, a dotted breve, is 1152 units long.

At this resolution, a 32-bit signed integer can store a maximum
duration of (nearly) 2^31 / 6 hemidemisemiquavers, which is 2^26 / 3
crotchets, which is just short of 5.6 million bars of 4/4 time.

The delta-times in MIDI files are represented in terms of the
timebase, defined in the MIDI file-format standard as the number of
delta-time units per crotchet.  So to convert from MIDI file deltas to
our time units, multiply by 96 and divide by the timebase.

Introduction
------------

Rosegarden Version 4.0 for KDE works only with the aRts sound system
that comes with the KDE multimedia packages.

To get the development version of Rosegarden to work you'll need to
ensure that artsd is running, can find the relevant Rosegarden
server stubs and that you've mapped the sequencer output to a relevant
port.


  Update 19.9.2001

  This far results are patchy.  Testing on my machine gives random
  results - sometimes playback is acceptable, sometimes it is lagged
  and choppy.  Guillaume's testing so far has been successful - playback
  seeming to be solid enough.  This could still be a system issue or an
  artsd issue or a Rosegarden issue though.



Building aRts
-------------

Rosegarden MIDI recording only works with arts-0.5.4
(including arts-extras-0.5.4) or later.

To install a new version of aRTs on your system:

o download from http://www.arts-project.org
o build and install to a good place (say /opt/arts-0.n.m)
o ensure LD_LIBRARY_PATH or ldconfig can find the relevant libs
o setup your ~/.mcoprc point to include these libs as well (see below)


Starting and stopping artsd
---------------------------

Artsd usually starts with your UID as you log into (say) KDE.  When
developing with artsd it's advisable to run it in the foreground with
debug on ('-l0') to catch any messages.

Start artsd (something) like this:

 % artsd -F 10 -S 4096 -a oss -l0

Open artscontrol (KDE menu item under Multimedia/Sound) and from that
open the MidiManager.  To use the MIDI ports of your soundcard map the
MidiManager to the OSS midi ports (try either /dev/midi or /dev/midi00).

If you do restart artsd at any point you'll have to restart your arts
clients as well (artscontrol, rosegardensequencer).

Once the Rosegarden sequencer starts up it'll create two new MIDI ports
labelled Playback and Record.  These can be connected to anything you
can create in the MidiManager.



Registering the Rosegarden implementations with artsd
-----------------------------------------------------

To get artsd to work with the Rosegarden MCOP implementations
we have to tweak your $HOME/.mcoprc file and restart artsd to
pick up the changes.

You need to add entries to the directory that holds these files:

  RosegardenMidiRecord.mcopclass
  libMidiArts.la

A complete example file (indented) as follows:


  # global port - we use the temp directory
  #
  #
  GlobalComm=Arts::TmpGlobalComm

  # rwb 06/01 - don't use spaces between the elements in this list
  # as aRts won't pick them up.
  #
  #
  ExtensionPath="/usr/lib","/usr/lib/mcop","/home/bownie/rosegarden/sound/"
  TraderPath="/usr/lib/mcop","/home/bownie/rosegarden/sound/"


Once you've edited ~/.mcoprc then you'll have to restart artsd to
pick up the changes


Configuring for playback using aRts Midi Manager
------------------------------------------------

Once you have everything built for Rosegarden and you've made the
changes to your ~/.mcoprc you should ensure artsd is running and
then you're ready to start up the application.

You can start either "rosegardengui" or "rosegardensequencer" first
as they only look for each other's presence when they need them (i.e.
when playing or recording).

When "rosegardensequencer" starts up it'll let you know its status on the
command line.  If you're running the artscontrol MidiManager you should
see the Rosegarden Play and Record ports registering with aRts.

Successfully creating the System Midi Port (OSS) on the arts Midi Manager
will enable you to send and receive MIDI events from your soundcard's
MIDI ports.  Creating an aRts Synthesis Midi Output device is equivalent
to a soft synth (TiMidity type device) which can also act as a sink for
Rosegarden events and allow you to test the sequencer without needing any 
external MIDI equipment or cables.

At the moment a limitation of the aRts Midi Manager is that every time
aRts is restarted you'll need to recreate devices and mappings and also
that the synthesis devices are not multitimbral - i.e. an entire piece
will only be played in the single voice that the Play port is connected
to.


Testing the Rosegarden Sequencer
--------------------------------

Assuming you've followed all of the above steps you should have
now have the rosegardensequencer running, the artscontrol Midi Manager
showing Rosegarden Play and Record ports and at least one available
Midi Output port that'll allow you to test whether the Sequencer is
making sound i.e. an OSS Midi Port that's connect to an external
MIDI device or an aRts synthesis device.  Select the Rosegarden (Play)
port and the output port you want and "Connect" them together.

If you know start the "rosegardengui" application and load in a test
file you should be able to hit "Play" on the sequencer and hear some
playback.  The song position pointer on the GUI should move from
left to right across the screen in time with the notes being sent out.
Note that at the moment you can Fast Forward and Rewind whilst the
sequencer is stopped or playing.

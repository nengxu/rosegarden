Rosegarden-4 Translation mini-HOWTO
===================================


Document maintained by: Hans Kieserman <hkieserman at mail dot com>


For Users
---------

A list of supported languages is available at our website.  This list
is currently empty, but at least French, Russian, and British English
are in progress.  Please make your wishes known on the mailing list if
you can translate musical or technical terminology, or need a
translated version of RG.

After you confirm that we support your language, the following three
steps will get you started with Rosegarden-4 in your native language:

  1) Install Rosegarden-4.  If you have KDE running in your language
  already, that's all you need.  Otherwise, you also need to make sure
  kdebase, kde-i18n-<languageCode>, locales, and locales-<languageCode>
  are installed.

  2) Set your locale to the language you require. For Mandrake/KDE
  users, this is accomplished with KDE menu/Control
  Center/Personalization/Country&Language.  Otherwise this can be done
  manually in your favorite shell by setting the environment variable
  KDE_LANG to your language/locale code of choice.  Example: In the
  Bash shell, type "export KDE_LANG=fr" (no quotes) to use RG in the
  French language.

  3) Start Rosegarden-4.

It's that easy!

Problems with the translations or contributions should be sent to
rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net .


For Translators
---------------

Open your language file and start translating!  The KDE project has a
tool called KBabel which helps manage translated strings, but any text
editor that supports UTF-8 is fine.  It is also rumored that the iconv
tool is usable for converting to UTF-8 from whatever your editor
supports.

When you are ready to submit your translations, send new files or CVS
diffs to the mailing list.  We encourage you to release early and
often.

If no translation yet exists for your language, make a copy of the
file po/rosegarden.pot.  Name the copied file languageCode.po, where
languageCode is the ISO locale code for your language.

For example, the code for Russian is "ru" (no quotes), so the Russian
translation should be found in ru.po.  A locale-specific example is
en_GB.po, which is British English.

The rosegarden.pot file is available from CVS, or on the web at
<URL:http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/po/>.

Discussion regarding translations is handled for the moment on
rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, although a translation-only
list may be opened if there is enough traffic.


For Developers
--------------

A few quick notes:

Please note that the base/ directory does not use QString, and so
cannot be translated with the KDE tools.  If you think a string needs
to be there that absolutely must be translated, the mailing list is
the best place to work this out.

Unfortunately, someone has made the decision that American English be
the default language for KDE apps, so all internal strings should
originate in American English.  (I believe setting one's environment
to en_US is a no-op? Please correct me if I'm wrong- it may just be
the case that my default environment of en_US doesn't allow any en_US
po translations.)

Finally, after adding a new language, don't forget to re-run make -f
Makefile.cvs and configure to let the Makefiles know about it.


Writing code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only thing you really need to know is to wrap all strings that
need to be translated with the i18n() function, for example,
i18n("Open File").

However, please read the following- it will save work in the long run.

  - There is a version of the i18n method with two arguments.  The
  first arg is an explanation of exactly what the second arg is used
  for, which helps translators understand ambiguous cases.  (Only the
  second arg is translated.) For example, "View" in English may be
  used as a verb or noun, which are translated differently in
  different languages.

  - All languages do not have the same rules about word order.  Using
  the Qstring::arg() method allows easy re-ordering for translation
  purposes.

  BAD: msg = i18n("Loading file ") + filename

  GOOD: msg = i18n("Loading file %1").arg(filename)

  PROBABLY WON'T WORK AT ALL: msg = i18n("Loading " + filename + " for import")

  - arg() should also be used for non-translated strings (proper
  names, etc) or frequently-changing strings such as version numbers.

Maintaining the translation files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every once in a while, the main rosegarden.pot file should be updated
from the latest source files with the commands

  $ make -f admin/Makefile.common package-messages
  $ make

Similarly, language files can be "merged" to include new diffs using

  $ make -f admin/Makefile.common package-merge POFILES=po/*.po PACKAGE=po/rosegarden

If the changes are large or it has been a long time since the last
update, announce on the mailing list to get the legions involved in
updating all translated files.

Note: The above "make" commands require the file kde.pot to be in
$KDEDIR/include/kde.pot, so if you get an error use "locate kde.pot"
to find it and then set KDEDIR appropriately.


Overview of KDE translation system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above "make" commands find all of the i18n strings in the codebase
and put them in the reference file po/rosegarden.pot.  One .pot file
is created per executable, so there's also one for the sequencer,
which is not used at the moment- if we ever decide to translate that
as well, we'll need to manage the po/ directory a bit differently
because the language files will crash into each other.

This file should be checked in occasionally, along with the merged
translated language files.

At runtime, the system looks in the
$KDEDIR/share/locale/$KDE_LANG/LC_MESSAGES/rosegarden.mo file for
strings that match the arguments to i18n and replaces them with the
translated versions if available.  See the developer.kde.org link
above for repercussions with respect to translating #defines, etc.

Installing ALSA 0.9.0beta12 on a Mandrake 8.1 system
----------------------------------------------------
rwb 08.04.2002

Get the packages (driver, lib and utils) from www.alsa-project.org.
Make and install.  The latest versions of ALSA won't compile with
currently stable verions of aRts anymore as the ALSA API has changed
(significantly) recently.  Make sure you compile all future versions
of aRts _without_ ALSA support until aRts catches up (presumably post
0.6.0 versions).

When installed configuration is mainly through the /etc/modules.conf
file as with previous versions of ALSA.  Note that some modules names
may have subtely changed!

There is the "Mandrake devfs problem" as documented in this link:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/alsa-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02737.html

This is a major gotcha.  Switching off devfs support in your lilo or
grub boot menu should fix this problem.

(Note  - 29.09.2002 : Recent MDK versions like 9.0 come with Alsa 0.9
correctly configured).

Search the alsa-users list archive for any other specific problems:

More Notes
----------

Note that OSS/aRts likes to grab the external MIDI ports.  If the
ALSA client isn't connecting to the input MIDI port then try 
shutting down aRts.

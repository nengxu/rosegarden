FAQ for Rosegarden-4
====================


As there is not yet any user documentation provided for Rosegarden-4,
this FAQ includes a number of bits of useful information that would
normally (and will in the future) be found there instead.


Compilation or installation problems
------------------------------------

KDE2 or KDE3?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've managed to end up in a bit of a mess with our attempts to
support both KDE2 and KDE3.  The code builds for both, but you have to
ensure the correct "admin" directory is present in the top-level
directory, and if you change the admin directory you then have to run
"make -f Makefile.cvs" before starting to configure and build.

For the 0.1.6 release, the default admin directory is for KDE3, and
there's an admin_kde2 for KDE2 builds.  For this release, just follow
the instructions in the INSTALL about changing over the directories if
you're using KDE2.

For earlier releases, the reverse was true -- the default admin
directory was for KDE2 and there was an admin_kde3 for KDE3 builds.
Again, this is as described in the INSTALL files for those releases.

However, for current CVS builds, *the INSTALL file is wrong*.  The
INSTALL contains the 0.1.6 instructions, but in fact the default admin
directory is for KDE2 and there's an admin_kde3 for KDE3 builds.  To
build these for KDE3, you'll need to move admin out of the way and
rename admin_kde3 to admin before running "make -f Makefile.cvs" --
just as in the KDE2 instructions in the INSTALL only in reverse.


arts/artsmidi.idl not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may be missing the kdemultimedia package (and associated -devel
package, if appropriate to your distribution).  Note that you need
this even if you're building --with-alsa.


"Cannot convert a null image" and other errors at startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're getting a stream of errors of this sort followed by a crash
at startup, with Rosegarden-4 0.1.6 or earlier, then you probably
haven't run "make install", or it didn't complete successfully, or it
installed into a non-standard place which you need to add to your
KDEDIRS environment variable before you can start it correctly.


The Composition View
--------------------

How do I set a loop?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While holding down Shift and and the left mouse button sweep out a loop
region in the ruler at the top or bottom of the main composition window.  
The loop icon in the transport will become enabled and playback will 
always occur within this loop until you disable it.  You can disable
the loop by clicking on the loop icon or shift+left clicking in either
loop ruler.


How do I view the track labels?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the main window go to Settings->View Track Labels


How do I change the instrument for a track?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click and hold the left mouse button on the track/instrument label.
A pop-up will appear from which you can choose a new instrument for
the track.


Notation and Matrix editing
---------------------------

Can I edit all the segments at once in the notation editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _Open in Notation Editor_ option on the main view's _Segments_
menu will open all the currently-selected segments together in a
single editor.  So to open them all, first use the _Edit_ menu's
_Select All Segments_ option, then this one.  (You can also edit a
subset of segments by selecting them with shift-click on the main
view, then using _Open in Notation Editor_.)


Can I edit all the segments at once in the matrix editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.  A matrix editor shows a single segment only.


Notation rendering is rather slow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, it can be.  Unlike most other notation applications (including
Rosegarden 2.1), we render the full length of each segment to a canvas
when the notation editor starts, instead of rendering sections at a
time when it scrolls.  This means scrolling should be smooth and quick
but the initial rendering phase relatively slow.  This can be a
problem for long segments, although for other practical reasons you're
probably better off dividing long pieces into more manageable segments
anyway.

You can speed things up somewhat by switching to the RG21 font, which
doesn't look as nice but is easier to draw (though there's not yet any
way to make it the default, so you have to wait until the rendering
has happened before you can switch to it -- oops).  You can also make
scrolling smoother by switching off the chord-label ruler.

There is a particular problem with Qt 2.3.0 and anti-aliased fonts: if
you're using Qt 2.3.0 and have anti-aliased fonts enabled, rendering
performance can be dramatically slower than it should be -- even if
you aren't actually using any anti-aliased fonts in Rosegarden.  See
the Rosegarden-4 README for more details, and consider switching off
anti-aliasing or upgrading to Qt 3 (i.e. KDE 3).


Playback and recording
----------------------


aRts?  ALSA?  Huh?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right, it's like this.  Rosegarden-4 can be built without any sound
support ("configure --disable-sound"), with aRts support (the default
configure option), or with ALSA support ("configure --with-alsa").
You have to choose one option when you run configure: you can't
currently have more than one compiled in.

aRts (<URL:http://www.arts-project.org/>) is the standard KDE sound
server.  In theory, it supports audio, MIDI soft synths and outboard
MIDI devices.  In practice the only way you're likely to get good
performance from Rosegarden using aRts is if you have a small number
of outboard hardware MIDI synths and they're all you want to use.
aRts will not drive your soundcard's onboard MIDI synth, the standard
soft synths sound ghastly, and audio/MIDI synchronisation doesn't work
yet.  On the plus side, aRts has a potentially sophisticated
soft-synth architecture if you want to develop your own synths, and it
may be possible to use it on systems other than Linux.

ALSA (<URL:http://www.alsa-project.org/>) is the standard sound system
in Linux 2.5+, and is available for installation on earlier versions
of Linux.  (Some distributions also include it as an optional
package.)  Rosegarden-4 supports ALSA version 0.9.0 (_not_ 0.5.x),
with which it can play to outboard MIDI synths, onboard soundcard MIDI
synths, and ALSA soft-synths, and can record from outboard MIDI
devices.  Setup is easier than with aRts, at least once ALSA is
installed.  For audio support with ALSA, you will also need to obtain
and use JACK (<URL:http://jackit.sourceforge.net/>).

We strongly recommend you use ALSA unless you already know you prefer
aRts or you simply can't get ALSA for your platform.  Every
Rosegarden-4 feature that works with aRts also works with ALSA, and
then some.  The only reason aRts is the default configure option is
that we wrote the aRts driver before the ALSA driver.


Can I use an ALSA soft synth, such as iiwusynth?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep.  Make sure you're running iiwusynth in the alsa-seq mode and make
sure you run it up _before_ you run up Rosegarden.  They you should get
iiwusynth channels available in the Instrument dropdowns (click and hold
on the Track labels).

Start up iiwusynth something like this:

   $ iiwusynth -m alsa_seq path/to/soundfont.sf2

Then start Rosegarden and assign some Tracks to the "Synth input port"
Instrument.  By default RG will choose the onboard synth first so
you'll have to manually reassign these Tracks.


How do I select an Instrument?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check which Instrument is selected for your Track by making sure
that Settings->Show Track Labels is unchecked.  You can change Instrument
for a Track by clicking and holding on the Track/Instrument label.  A
pop up menu will appear from which you can select a different output
Instrument.  Rosegarden automatically assigns the first available synth
device on your soundcard for it's default output Instrument when importing
MIDI files.


I'm using ALSA and I've selected a synth Instrument but I don't hear any sound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're hearing silence with a Synth device (say "Emuk10k1 Port 0" or
"OPL 3") then make sure you've loaded a soundfont for your soundcard.
To load soundfonts use the "sfxload" utility.  For example the Creative
SBLive! soundcard comes with a set of standard soundfonts (2gmgsmt.sf2,
4gmgsmt.sf2, 8mbgmsfx.sf2) and you can load the 8MB soundfont as follows:

  $ sfxload 8mbgmsfx.sf2

For more fun with soundfonts including how to create them for yourself

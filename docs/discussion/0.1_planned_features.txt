Features for release 0.1
========================

A.  Features without which nobody will even believe we're serious:

1.  be able to store music in multiple tracks and display multiple
    tracks (one notation window per track) : DONE

2.  updating one edit window when something is edited in another
    (however crudely we do it at first).  -- at the moment if you
    delete a note in one window then insert in another, it crashes

3.  track part deletion : DONE

4.  proper saving/restoring of track part start time DONE

5.  note insertion (by replacing rests) : DONE

6.  note deletion

7.  chording of a note which is of a different length than the ones already
    present (the longer note must be split)

8.  proper handling of time sigs. Tracks should be positioned at
    absolute steps, not bars : DONEish

9.  all the notation elegances (more precise description needed here) : DONEish
9a. make it possible to insert dotted notes and notes with accidentals

10. be able to both read and write MIDI files, even if we only handle
    the most basic events

11. basic MIDI record and playback infrastructure through aRts (RB - 18.06.01)

12. the basics of Rosegarden 2.1 file loading


===

B.  The basis for more advanced features, where that basis should be
    done as soon as possible:

1.  undo stack

2.  multiple editor windows on a same track

3.  "environments" à la Logic.

4.  selection/deletion/editing etc of single events and groups thereof

5.  track properties dialog

6.  setting the time default sig of newly created tracks
    (and selecting the appropriate sort of rest to fill up the tracks
    with -- and should it be possible to change the rest type for a whole
    filled section at once, after the fact?)

7.  moveable begin and end markers in tracks

8.  show several tracks in a single notation window


===

C.  Cleaning up the code and organisation such that it's as pleasant as
    possible for other people to read and work with:
 
1.  sort the source files in rosegardengui a bit better (core/,
    gui/main/, gui/notation/, gui/trackedit)

2.  do a global core + rosegardengui Makefile

3.  clean up XML code so that it's not spread over RosegardenGUIDoc and
    RoseXMLHandler

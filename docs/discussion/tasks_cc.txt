  * Take a careful look at the situations in which accidentals
    do and don't appear, and make sure they're correct.  Handle
    the principle of hiding an accidental if it's already
    appeared once within the same bar.

  * Make it possible to insert dotted notes and notes with
    accidentals. (May need help from Guillaume on the Qt side.)

  * Tidy up the way notes and chords are drawn -- for example,
    notes with accidentals currently "eat" some of the space
    before them; chords with second intervals should have one
    notehead shifted (RG2.1 does this imperfectly but well
    enough for our purposes); chords usually have too long
    stems (a note on its own should have a stem longer than
    the length a chord stem extends from the notehead nearest
    its tail).

D * Add basic support for beamed groups
 
  * Make beam code cope properly with partial beams

  * Make sure clef/key/time-signature combinations appear
    in the correct order (this will probably be a real hack,
    just as it is in RG2.1, because it's very difficult to
    enforce an order in storage and much simpler to choose
    the order when assigning x-coordinates).

  * Sort out XML format so as to make bools unambiguous: the
    winning representation appears to be

      <event type="note" duration="minim">
      <prop name="pitch" int="50"/>
      <prop name="NoteStalkUp" bool="false"/>
      </event>

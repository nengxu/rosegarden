D * Take a careful look at the situations in which accidentals
    do and don't appear, and make sure they're correct.

D * Handle the principle of hiding an accidental if it's already
    appeared once within the same bar.

  * Make it possible to insert dotted notes and notes with
    accidentals. (May need help from Guillaume on the Qt side.)

D? * Tidy up the way notes and chords are drawn -- for example,
    notes with accidentals currently "eat" some of the space
    before them; chords with second intervals should have one
    notehead shifted (RG2.1 does this imperfectly but well
    enough for our purposes); chords usually have too long
    stems (a note on its own should have a stem longer than
    the length a chord stem extends from the notehead nearest
    its tail).

D * Add basic support for beamed groups
 
D * Make beam code cope properly with partial beams

  * Make sure clef/key/time-signature combinations appear
    in the correct order (this will probably be a real hack,
    just as it is in RG2.1, because it's very difficult to
    enforce an order in storage and much simpler to choose
    the order when assigning x-coordinates).

D * Sort out XML format so as to make bools unambiguous: the
    winning representation appears to be

      <event type="note" duration="minim">
      <property name="pitch" int="50"/>
      <property name="NoteStalkUp" bool="false"/>
      </event>

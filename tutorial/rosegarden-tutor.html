<H1 ALIGN=LEFT>1. So you want to use Rosegarden... 
</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>1.1 Getting Rosegarden</H2>
<P>So you want to use Rosegarden...</P>
<P>The Rosegarden home page is at
<A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/index.html">http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/index.html</A>
and I'll leave it to you to start there and work outward if you can't
come up with some way to get Rosegarden running on your machine.</P>
<P>This tutorial assumes that you already <B>have</B> a recent
version of Rosegarden 4, and that it's working properly. I'll give
you the standard cop-out: if you can't compile it yourself, get
someone who <I>can</I> to package it for your distro, so that you can
just install it from a pre-rolled package. Several distros already
have a rosegarden4 or rosegarden-4 package available, and many more
will follow in due course.</P>
<P><I>Adventuresome people--especially Debian users--wanting to play
with the CVS may wish to take a look at my </I><A HREF="get-rg.tar.gz"><I>get-rg</I></A><I>
script. I'm not going to go into detail on how to use it, or how to
alter it to suit different environments. Its purpose is to simplify
the job of staying up to date with CVS by logging in, updating,
compiling, and then managing packages via checkinstall. I include it
only because it's so extremely convenient to use that I hate to keep
it to myself. I eventually plan to make it universal enough to
compile anything from CVS, and install packages on any distro that
checkinstall supports, but that is low on my list of priorities at
the moment.</I></P>
<H2><BR><BR>
</H2>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>1.2 Introduction to the Tutorial</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">My goal in writing this
tutorial is to learn through teaching. You and I are in this together
every step of the way. Rosegarden has come quite a long way since its
beginnings, and this new Rosegarden is an impressive, feature-packed
and useful application, once you discover just how to go about using
it.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It has goodies in every nook and cranny, but it is a
unique application unto itself, probably unlike anything else you've
used before, and you most likely won't immediately understand how to
make use of all of its features. Rosegarden doesn't try to mimic any
particular application, and so you have to get to know and love it on
its own terms, to work <I>with</I> the software instead of against
it, in order to get where you want to be. 
</P>
<P>My aim here is not to write an exhaustive manual that covers every
single possibility in detail. This tutorial isn't necessarily
organized in a way that makes it easy to look up information about
particular features later. This is a meandering journey through
Rosegarden, taking you through a real-world project and showing you
things of interest along the way. I hope that by sharing my
experiences with you, we'll both be able to get more out of this
exciting new package.</P>
<P>As I write this, I'm compiling CVS almost every day. Bugs are
being stomped out, details of some portions of the user interface are
being hashed out, and an overall refinement is taking place. As such,
some of the screenshots may not match the Rosegarden in front of you
exactly. I don't expect huge changes, but when you attempt to
document a work in progress, it's impractical to keep up with every
last bit of wording or change of pixmap that might take place along
the way. I will endeavor to keep this tutorial up to date to the
extent that it continues to be useful, but I don't plan to take new
screenshots of everything to mirror each minor revision.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT>2. Let's Make Music 
</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Our Sample Project Background</H2>
<P>I want to burn a CD of myself playing music for my grandmother. I
want to play the melody on my flute and record myself along with MIDI
accompaniment. My theme for this on-going project is actually
Christmas music (I'm writing this in December), but in order to avoid
possible Copyright infringement issues on any of the vast collection
of MIDI files I've accumulated over the years, I'm going to work with
an original composition in this tutorial. Inspiration to compose only
strikes me a few times a decade, and I'm not currently inspired. As
such, I'm pulling something out of the archives. This may not be a<B>
good</B> composition, but I own the rights to it, and can mangle it
any way I choose without fear of anything more than rotten food being
thrown at my head. :)</P>
<P>So let's start with this little piece that I arranged for eventual
inclusion in a computer game. I gave no particular thought to ever
playing this live on real instruments, since it was to be part of a
game. It's fairly short, intended to be looped, and it makes for a
good first adventure. Let's see what we can do with it to make it
both interesting and playable, and learn about Rosegarden along the
way.</P>
<P>So you can follow along at home, you can get a copy of the file
here: <A HREF="midi/ultima.mid">ultima.mid</A> 
</P>
<H2><BR><BR>
</H2>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Main Window</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Importing a MIDI File</H3>
<P>Start Rosegarden, then use <B>File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import MIDI
File</B>... from the menu. Navigate to the location of the file and
import it. 
</P>
<P>Once imported, your screen should resemble this. If it doesn't,
take a look at the <B>Settings</B> menu and toggle all the optional
displays on: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><A HREF="pixmaps/snapshot1.png"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot1.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT><A HREF="pixmaps/snapshot1.png">
</A>
</P>
<P>Now that we've imported the file, let's see how it fared. 
</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</H3>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Playing With Transport Tools</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Playback Pointer</H4>
<P>First, we need to see what it sounds like. Let's get to know the
<B>Transport</B> window, and the<B> Playback Pointer</B>,<B> </B>which
are two of the tools we'll use to get around in our compositions.</P>
<P>Notice that there's a vertical blue bar in the <B>Segment Pane</B>
of the main window. That is the <B>Playback Pointer</B>. You can move
it to any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking on the <B>Ruler</B>
at the top, or you can use the <B>Transport</B> to move it around. If
you don't see it, play with the <B>Transport</B> or the <B>Ruler
</B>until you move it out of hiding.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/playback-pointer.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0></H2>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Transport Window</H4>
<P>You'll initially have a separate, floating <B>Transport</B> window
like this one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot2.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="Transport Window" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=428 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0></P>
<P>If you can't figure out what any of the buttons do, hover over
them a bit, and context-sensitive help will pop up. Of special note
are the<B> Panic</B>,<B> Metronome</B>,<B> </B>and<B> Solo </B>buttons.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I><IMG SRC="pixmaps/transport-play-panic.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0></I></P>
<P>The <B>Panic</B> button transmits an &ldquo;all notes off&rdquo;
message. Use it, for example, when your synth has gotten a note stuck
and the incessant droning of that low C# is driving you up the wall.</P>
<P>The <B>Metronome</B> does what you'd probably expect. You can turn
the metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it
is a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>Solo</B> button mutes all
tracks except for the one that's currently selected, allowing you a
convenient way to hear just one part.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Tweaking the Import</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Changing the Program, Part One</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Find the<B> Play/Pause </B>button and give this
composition a listen. It sounds rather lame after this initial
import, doesn't it? <I>(Of course, your results will vary depending
on the synth you have available as well.)</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Before you write me off as a terrible composer, let's
get this back to the condition it was in when it left Cakewalk last
year. We need to correct for what has been lost in the translation
from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then we'll play
with it. You'll find the <B>Instrument Parameters</B> here:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I><IMG SRC="pixmaps/instrument-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0></I></P>
<P>First, we really need to change the drum kit. This piece is
supposed to use the Orchestral set. It sounds pretty lame with the
standard drum kit, and Rosegarden has dropped the program change from
that track, possibly due to my <B>Studio</B> settings. Well, no
matter, we'll work around it now and worry about doing it elegantly
later. (Much later. The <B>Studio</B> is undergoing some exciting new
changes at the moment, and will be <I>very</I> useful by the time I
get around to writing about it. That's why I'm putting off mentioning
one of Rosegarden's most important features until nearer the end of
my tutorial, in <B>Changing the Program Part Two</B>.)</P>
<P>Until we do something about drum kit patch names in the <B>Studio</B>,
we'll just use the default General MIDI patch names. About the best
we can do at this point is click through the various names until we
find our drum kit. First we need to select the first of the two drum
tracks, the one labeled &ldquo;Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare&rdquo;
so that its parameters are displayed in the<B> Instrument Parameters</B>
pane.</P>
<P>Click on the track name to select it. Now click on the <B>Program</B>
button. If the checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you can scroll
through with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the drop-down
list. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/dropdown.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="dropdown list" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=202 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P><I>(It so happens that &ldquo;String Ensemble&rdquo; corresponds
to the GS program number for the &ldquo;OrcheSet&rdquo; drum kit...
YMMV. I discovered this by trial and error, as you must. We'll do
this more elegantly later, don't worry.)</I></P>
<P>Now it's starting to sound better, but there's still work to do.
Let's move on to playing with segments.</P>
<H2><BR><BR>
</H2>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-style: normal">A First Look at Segments</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Using Segments to Layer Parts</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Now is a good time to take a first look
at what segments are all about.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">What <B>are</B> these
segments anyway? They're one of Rosegarden's most powerful features,
allowing you to slide notes and audio samples around at will, to cut
them up, re-combine them, overlap them, and so on, giving you a high
degree of control over the sound of your composition. Let's make use
of this feature immediately to deal with an import problem.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">You may have noticed some raunchy piano
notes that were supposed to be a conga. When I created this file, I
had two different percussion tracks tied to channel 10. That was
Cakewalk. This is Rosegarden, so let's deal with this the Rosegarden
way.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Rather assigning two tracks to the same
channel, inviting opportunities for one to interfere with the other,
we'll take advantage of overlapping segments to achieve the same
result. This will allow us to keep the two portions of the drum
pattern separate from each other in a single track.</P>
<P>Take a look at the <B>Segment Pane</B> to the right. This is where
you can re-arrange things on a large scale. Notice the <B>Ruler</B>
at the top, the <B>Chord Indicator Bar</B>, the <B>Track Names</B>
and the <B>Segments</B>. Observe that each track has a <B>Mute</B>
and <B>Record</B> button. If any of these features are missing from
your display, you can toggle them via the <B>Settings</B> menu:</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/segment-pane.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=502 HEIGHT=284 BORDER=0></H2>
<P>Let's start by cutting out all the empty spaces, and cutting these
huge segments into smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P>Use <B>Edit -&gt; Select All Segments</B> from the menu to
highlight all of the segments. Then use <B>Segments -&gt; Auto-Split</B>
to automatically split them, eliminating sections of silence, and
leaving you with little islands of notey bits. 
</P>
<P>To get a better overview of the composition, use the <B>Zoom</B>
slider at the top right of the main window to zoom out a bit.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/zoom.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=277 HEIGHT=122 BORDER=0></H2>
<P>Your screen should then resemble this: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><A HREF="snapshot4.png"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot4.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT><A HREF="pixmaps/snapshot4.png">
</A>
</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>2.5.2 Segment Previews</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Look closely, and you'll notice that each one of the
segments contains a miniature &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; or &ldquo;piano
roll&rdquo; view. You can get some sense of what that bit of music is
like just by looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual
aid when dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on,
turn it on with <B>Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-style: normal"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/snapshot5.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="enlarged view of segments" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=501 HEIGHT=283 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Now, let's overlap the
segments. Select the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo; segment, and drag it up to
the &ldquo;Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare&rdquo; track. 
</P>
<P>Your screen should now resemble this: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><A HREF="post-overlap-layer.png"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-overlap-layer.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 BORDER=2></FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>For now, we'll leave the &ldquo;Conga&rdquo; track in
place. The layering we've done gets both of these tracks into the
same MIDI channel with aplomb, but we may need to drag the big track
back out so that we can more readily get to the smaller ones beneath.
I don't see a way to select a segment that's buried entirely beneath
another segment.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now that the drum kit has been corrected and both drum
parts are playing on the correct channel, it's starting to shape up.
The only thing missing is reverb. It sounds rather dull without it.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Instrument Parameters</H2>
<P>The SysEx bank that Cakewalk included with this file has been lost
in the translation. Luckily, Rosegarden makes it easy to set the
initial values for the most common controllers right there in the
<B>Instrument Parameters</B> pane of the main window. If this is
missing from your display, toggle it on with <B>Settings -&gt; Show
Instrument Parameters.</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I><IMG SRC="pixmaps/instrument-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0></I></P>
<P>Let's select each track in turn, and dial up the 'verb. Click on
the <B>Reverb</B> knob and either use your mouse wheel or else drag
the cursor in a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to
drag it around in a circle) to change the position of the knob. Crank
it up. You can never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat
until every track has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if
you insist on having less than maximal 'verbage...) 
</P>
<P>Depending on your synth's implementation, you can control several
other parameters from this panel as well. <B>Volume</B>, <B>Pan</B>,
<B>Chorus</B>, and <B>Reverb</B> are perhaps the most commonly-used.
If any of these knobs don't seem to have any effect, blame it on your
synth.</P>
<P>Now is a good time to save. Remember to <B><U>save early, save
often</U></B>. Rosegarden is still under heavy development, and it's
not fun to see your work evaporate. If you do discover a bug, try to
determine a way to repeat it consistently, and let the Rosegarden
team know about it. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Making the Flute Part Playable 
</H1>
<P>We'll do more with segments as we progress. For the moment, let's
consider that flute part. It's way, way too high to be playable, so
it needs to be transposed.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Segment Parameters</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are several ways to transpose in Rosegarden,
depending on what you want to do. If you just want to affect
playback, you can configure the transposition in the <B>Segment
Parameters</B> pane of the main window. This allows you to add a
playback delay, on-the-fly quantization, segment repeat or, of
course, transposition for any segment. Now is a good time to play
with these, and see some of the things they can do, though we can't
use them for the task at hand, since they only affect performance.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/segment-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=137 BORDER=0></P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Opening the Notation Editor</H2>
<P>Since we want to make changes with the eventual aim of printing a
playable score, we're going to need to &ldquo;physically&rdquo; move
the notes. So, for starters, let's see what this actually looks like
in terms of notation.</P>
<P>Let's open the <B>Notation Editor</B> and have a look. Highlight a
segment from the &ldquo;Flute&rdquo; track. Open the <B>Notation
Editor</B> by right-clicking on the segment, and choosing &ldquo;<B>Edit
as Notation</B>&rdquo; from the context submenu. You can also
configure this to be your default view via <B>Settings -&gt;
Configure Rosegarden... -&gt; Default Editor</B>, and thereafter you
can get to the <B>Notation Editor</B> by merely double-clicking the
desired segment.</P>
<P>We'll be spending a lot of time here in the <B>Notation Editor</B>.
As you'd expect, this is where you go to view your data as standard
notation. In addition to displaying the note data on a human-readable
staff, it allows you add performance instructions to the score.</P>
<P>One of the first things you'll want to do is get yourself a local
set of <B>Transport</B> tools. Check <B>Settings -&gt; Show Transport
Toolbar</B> and the <B>Transport Toolbar</B> should appear. Notice
that it has buttons not found on the main <B>Transport</B> window.
These extra buttons are useful for controlling playback when the
<B>Playback Pointer</B> is outside the segment you're editing, and
you want to hear what you're working on.</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Notation Editor Controls</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's move the playback cursor to the
beginning of this segment. Click on the ruler above the staff to
position the local cursor, just as the ruler in the main window
positions the playback pointer itself. Click the <B>Playback Pointer
to Cursor 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-pointer-to-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=37 BORDER=0>
</B>button to move the playback pointer to the position of the
cursor. Now playback will begin from that point. You can set it back
&ldquo;out of sight&rdquo; so that playback will begin before the
start of the segment you're editing by shifting it to the left via
the 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-rewind.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0>
button.</P>
<P>Notice the <B>Size</B>, <B>Spacing</B>, and <B>Smoothing</B>
sliders.</P>
<P>The <B>Size</B> slider changes the size of the font used to render
the notes.</P>
<P>The <B>Spacing</B> slider can be used to adjust the horizontal
spacing of the notes, to draw them closer or further apart. Useful
for spreading out particularly complicated rhythms for easier
reading.</P>
<P>The <B>Smoothing</B> slider is useful for cleaning up performance
data somewhat, to make it more legible.</P>
<P>All of these controls are also available from the <B>View</B>
menu. <I>(Note that there is also a <B>View -&gt; Note Font</B>
option that isn't available graphically. Use this to switch between
&ldquo;feta&rdquo; and the &ldquo;rg2.1&rdquo; font. The latter isn't
is as pretty, but it renders more quickly on slower hardware.)</I></P>

</A>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Editing the Part</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Transposing</H3>
<P>Well, let's look at the part. This definitely should have been a
piccolo part. My head hurts just looking at this stuff. Let's
transpose it down an octave and see what it looks like. Let's make
that <B>two</B> octaves! I can get that high with my flute, but my
dog would hate me. Two octaves are good.</P>
<P>Select <B>Edit -&gt; Select Whole Staff</B>, then go to the
<B>Transforms</B> menu. Lots of good stuff to play with here, but we
want <B>Transpose...</B> Since we're going to go down two octaves, we
might as well go for the <B>Transpose...</B> option at the bottom.
Use the arrows to dial down, or else enter -24 into the input box.
Positive numbers mean an upward transposition, and negative numbers
will transpose downward.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/transpose-box.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=408 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Cleaning Up Ugly Data</H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that we're down to a reasonable
register, let's do something about the ugly notes. The problem with
human performance data is that it doesn't scale well into notation.
You'll notice that some of the notes are displaying in yellow. That's
because they're notes whose timing and duration don't quite make
sense to Rosegarden within the context of this measure, so it has
colored them to let you know that the notes on the page are only an
approximation of what will actually be played. To see a view of the
data in a more pure format, use the <B>Matrix</B> or <B>Event List</B>
editors, which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since our objective here is to make
the notation more readable, we might as well remain here and alter
the data until it better fits into place within the context of
notation. In this instance, readability is more important to us than
the faithful rendering of a human performance, so we're going to end
up making &ldquo;physical&rdquo; changes to the data along the way.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's start by seeing what that
<B>Smoothing</B> slider can do for us... Each notch makes the rhythm
progressively less obnoxious to read, leaving the notes in place.
Adjust the slider, and see what results. I found that the final notch
was too high, and the next lower notch was looking better, but wasn't
really quite there.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's try making these smoothed values
permanent. Select the whole staff, and let's try <B>Transform -&gt;
Fix Smoothed Values</B>...</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-fix-smoothed.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=630 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Well, that didn't quite have the
desired effect, did it? The timings are still too far off. Remember
<B>ctrl-Z</B> is a shortcut for <B>Edit -&gt; Undo</B>.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Quantize</H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I think this data is so messy that
we're going to have to quantize it. Let's <B>Undo</B> that last
change, and play with <B>Transform -&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's
tell it to <B>Quantize: Event positions, and round durations to exact
notes</B>. We'll leave the <B>Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>,
and accept the default <B>Note rounding</B> values and see where that
gets us:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/quantize.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Not too bad. It's looking much better:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=466 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's see how those changes
sound, and then we'll see about turning those 16<SUP>th</SUP>
note/rest pairs into something a little easier to read...</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The quantized notes seem to
have fallen into place along sane boundaries without having an undue
impact on the rhythm or feel of the piece. Bearing that in mind,
let's back up a step and see what would have happened if we had
quantized on 8<SUP>th</SUP> note boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B>
Edit -&gt; Undo</B>, then run through the<B> Transformations -&gt;
Quantize</B> dialog again, specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP>
note this time around.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Very nice indeed, and
Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and other odd bits
as required, ignoring the base duration when it really had to. That's
one of the best jobs of quantization I've seen in a notation editor.
There won't be much clean-up to do from here:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized2.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Adding Marks</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">We've changed the flavor
somewhat by lengthening those notes. Let's make them stacatto. There
isn't currently an icon for this, but you'll find it on the menu.
First you'll need to make a selection.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If it's not already the
default, choose the<B> Select</B> cursor 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-selection-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=55 BORDER=0>
from the<B> Toolbar</B>. Click at a point to the left of one of the
notes to begin the selection.<B> </B>Drag the blue selection box so
that it includes the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. When they're
selected, they'll turn blue. Now use <B>Marks -&gt; Add Stacatto</B>.
The dots appear:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized3.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Auto-Beam</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's add beams. <B>Edit
-&gt; Select Whole Staff</B>, then <B>Group -&gt; Auto Beam</B> to
beam these notes into logical groupings:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized4.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=348 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Changing Note Durations</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">One measure further into
the segment, there are some rhythms that could probably be written so
that they're less awkward to count. Let's see about changing them.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">There's an odd dotted 16<SUP>th</SUP>
with 32<SUP>nd</SUP> rest combination that should probably be another
stacatto 8<SUP>th</SUP> note:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized5.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=584 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's convert that into an
8<SUP>th</SUP> note. Click the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note button 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/notation-8th-note-button.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0>
on the <B>Toolbar</B>, then click on the offending dotted 16<SUP>th</SUP>
note's head. It changes into an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note, and the rest
disappears. <I>Note that Rosegarden pads out the rests as necessary,
to keep the correct time in the measure. </I>
</P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Let's Add Some Slurs</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's add some slurs as
well. Highlight the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes in this measure,
then use <B>Group -&gt; Add Slur</B>. You should be looking at
something very like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized6.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=398 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Manual Beaming</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's do two more
things to enhance readability. I'm used to reading beamed groups that
count out to one beat. Let's separate those two groups, and add
another slur. Select the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes in that
four-note group, then use <B>Group -&gt; Beam Group</B> to fuse those
two together. The remaining two notes adapt automatically, and remain
beamed. Now select all four of the 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes plus the half
note and add a slur. Finally, notice that the note stems are in the
way of the slur. Let's select the second pair of 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes
and use <B>Notes -&gt; Stem Direction -&gt; Stems Down</B> or else
<B>ctrl-PageDown</B> to change their direction. You should wind up
with a measure resembling this one:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized7.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Continue in this fashion
until you finish altering the notation so that it's nice and tidy. I
think you should have a pretty good idea how to proceed from here, so
I'm not going to walk you through the rest of this job.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Text Cursor</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now let's add some
directions. Exchange your <B>Select</B> cursor for a <B>Text 
<IMG SRC="pixmaps/text-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=34 BORDER=0></B>cursor.
Click toward the beginning of the staff, near the clef. Let's start
by adding a tempo and a dynamic of ff, (since my dynamic range is
from ff to fffff :). Click the cursor where you want the text to
appear, then configure it via the dialog.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/text-box.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=265 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">It's pretty
self-explanatory. My score ended up looking like:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="pixmaps/post-quantized8.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=184 BORDER=0></P>

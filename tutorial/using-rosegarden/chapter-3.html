	Listening to the Composition: Transport Tools</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Now that the file has been imported, we should listen and make sure
	there are no surprises. If the studio was properly configured, all
	the program changes in the MIDI file should have been imported
	correctly, but there are sometimes surprises.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Let's get to know the transport window, and the playback pointer,
	which are two of the tools we'll use to get around in our
	compositions.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Notice that there's a vertical blue bar at the left edge of the
	segment canvas. That bar is the playback pointer, and as it sweeps
	across the canvas, you'll hear the events as it passes over them.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	While you can't grab it and move it around directly, you can
	position it any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along
	the dark gray portion of the ruler at the top, or you can use the
	transport to move it around. If you don't see it, play with the
	transport or the ruler until you coax it out of hiding.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	You should have a separate, floating Transport window like this one.
	If it's not visible, then toggle it on with<B> Settings -&gt; Show
	Transport</B>.</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Most of
	these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out what any
	of the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and context-sensitive help
	will pop up.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Of
	special note are the p<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--> anic,
	metronome, and solo buttons. If they're missing, toggle the</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The p<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	anic button transmits a &quot;notes off&quot; message on every
	channel. Use it, for example, when your synth has gotten a note
	stuck and the incessant droning of that low F# is driving you up the
	wall.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
	metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is
	a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
	composition.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	The solo button mutes all tracks except for the one that's currently
	selected, allowing you a convenient way to hear just one part. (To
	&quot;solo&quot; more than one part, at present, you'll need to set
	the mute for tracks individually. The solo button only affects a
	single track.)</P>

	Tweaking Imported MIDI</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
	you understand how to use the transport, find the<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	play/pause button and give this composition a listen. It's very
	likely that it will sound somewhat lame initially. That's the result
	of a few issues that Rosegarden needs a bit of help to work around.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">This
	file was created with Cakewalk, and it includes a SysEx bank that
	would have set up the reverb level and various other paremeters on
	my synth. While Rosegarden does provide a facility for manipulating
	SysEx, it evidently doesn't know how to import Cakewalk-style SysEx
	dumps.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Another
	issue is the drum kit. It was supposed to have been &quot;OrcheSet,&quot;
	but the program change has gone into the bit bucket because
	Rosegarden doesn't currently recognize a need to handle program
	changes on channel 10.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">So,
	let's get this back to the condition it was in when it left Cakewalk
	a few years ago. We need to correct for what has been lost in the
	translation from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then
	we'll play with it. Fortunately, these minor issues are simple to
	fix up.</P>
	<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="3_1_1"></A>3.1.1
	Program Changes: Fixing GS Drums</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of
	the first things I like to do is assign meaningful names to the
	tracks as I explained previously, in section 2.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<IMG SRC="using-rosegarden_html_288360ec.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now, we
	really need to change the drum kit. As I mentioned in the<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	studio section, Rosegarden can't yet cope with having GS-style named
	drum kits on channel 10. It's on the table, but no decision has yet
	been made as to exactly how best to implement it. Until then, we'll
	have to live with having an instrument listed instead of our drum
	kit.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	It happens that &quot;OrcheSet&quot; has the same program number as
	&quot;Strings.&quot; We already have a track assigned to &quot;Strings,&quot;
	but it's on the wrong channel, so we can't simply scroll through the
	instrument/channel assignment menus to accomplish this. Instead, we
	need to have a look at the Instrument Parameters box of the main
	window.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<IMG SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m21c39b4a.png" NAME="Graphic50" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=239 BORDER=0></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If the<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	Program checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you can scroll through
	with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the drop-down list.
	It's helpful if your synth has a display so that you can see when
	you happen to get to the correct program number. That's how I
	arrived at the conclusion that &quot;Strings&quot; and &quot;OrcheSet&quot;
	have the same program number.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<IMG SRC="dropdown.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="dropdown list" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	Of course your mileage with all of this will surely vary depending
	on your gear.</P>
	<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="3_1_2"></A>3.1.2
	Program Changes: Fixing Drums with a Bank/Program Change</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	If you're running Fluid Synth, an SB Live!, and perhaps several
	types of hardware synths, you can change to an &quot;orchestral
	percussion&quot; drum kit by using a program/bank change
	combination.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	For example, I have a soundfont with an orchestral kit defined in
	bank 1:0. In this case, I imported the program names directly from
	the soundfont, and determining where to go with this is a simple
	matter.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	First I switch from the Roland SC-33 device to the Fluid Synth
	device, and then use the Instrument Parameters to dial in Bank 1:0
	(its default name after import) and scroll through until I find the
	right drum kit. This much easier than what GS users have to put up
	with.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	<IMG SRC="using-rosegarden_html_3cbfb425.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=140 BORDER=0>
		</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	Notice that I don't actually have Fluid Synth running, and thus
	there is no connection. These events will have no place to go until
	I start Fluid Synth or assign the Fluid Synth device to some other
	connection path. Rosegarden doesn't mind, because I have the device
	defined. If I start Fluid Synth, this will hook right up, and all
	will be well.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
	Now that the drums are a little more interesting, it's starting to
	sound better, but there's still work to do. We need to make up for
	that lost SysEx bank by cranking up the reverb.</P>
	<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="3_1_3"></A>3.1.3
	Controllers in Rosegarden</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
	SysEx bank that Cakewalk included with this file has been lost in
	the translation, and the reverb settings are gone. While there's not
	yet any working facility for manipulating arbitrary controllers at
	any point in a composition (it's in development), Rosegarden does
	provide a mechanism for setting up the initial values for several
	common controllers here in the<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	Instrument Parameters box. If you didn't notice this before, take
	note of the knobs in this box.</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I><IMG SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m2b0e6d92.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0></I></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Let's
	select each track in turn, and dial up the 'verb. Click on the<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	Reverb knob and either use your mouse wheel or else drag the cursor
	in a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to drag it
	around in a circle) to change the position of the knob. Crank it up.
	You can never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat until
	every track has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if you
	insist on having less than maximal 'verbage...)</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Depending
	on your synth's implementation, some of these knobs may not actually
	be useful to you. If any of these knobs don't seem to have any
	effect, chalk it up to your implementation. (In truth, I have no
	idea what several of them are supposed to do, and I have a real
	hardware synthesizer.)</P>

 Introduction</A></H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_1">1.1 What is Rosegarden?</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">Rosegarden-4, hereafter
 referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a versatile application that seeks
 to be a useful tool for those wanting to create music. It combines
 aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an audio sequencer, and a notation editor
 into one convenient, easy to use package that provides users with a
 consistent and mostly intuitive interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">Rosegarden is a native KDE
 application that can run on any system that has the KDE and QT
 libraries installed, and currently requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.0 in
 order to run. Many of its features may only work Linux systems, but it
 is designed to compile and run on any Unix-like platform capable of
 running KDE.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_2">1.2 This Guide's<I> Raison d'&ecirc;tre</I></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal">My goal in writing this guide
 is to help you explore Rosegarden, and to discover ways to use its
 features to solve real problems that you might encounter when creating
 your own music. Rosegarden is easy to use, once you come to understand
 its framework, but it's not quite like anything you are likely to have
 used in the past. As such, I wish to take you on a guided tour through
 Rosegarden, to demonstrate many of its capabilities, and to offer you a
 foundation from which your own creative projects can spring.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">My intention here is not to write an exhaustive
 technical manual that covers every single possibility in dry detail.
 This is a meandering journey through Rosegarden, taking you through
 real-world projects, and showing you things of interest along the way.
 I hope that by sharing my experiences and explaining how I've used
 Rosegarden to accomplish various and specific goals, we'll both be able
 to get more out of time spent with this application.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_3">1.3 Requirements</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I assume that you have at least Rosegarden 4 version
 0.8.5, and that it's working properly. I leave it to you to surf to the
 Rosegarden download page at<A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html">
</A><A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html">
 http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html</A><A HREF="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/download.html">
</A> and work outward from there if you don't already have a copy.
 Several distros already have a rosegarden4 or rosegarden-4 package
 available through mainstream or third-party channels, and if it isn't
 already, yours will probably be among them soon.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: Rosegarden is under constant development. As such, some
 details or screenshots described here may not exactly match the
 software in front of you. I intend to keep this guide useful, but I
 don't have the energy to re-write it and create new images from the top
 down every time someone adds a new icon somewhere. I'm attempting to
 keep this guide useful to those who are conservative enough to stay
 away from CVS, but I may slip. If something I'm writing about doesn't
 seem to exist, chances are that it was added since the last official
 release.</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_4">1.4 Intended Audience</A></H2>
<P>The demonstration projects featured in this guide are all based on
 problems that I have solved for myself in the time since I began using
 Rosegarden. They are strongly influenced by my own musical interest as
 an amateur, untrained composer, arranger, and musician.</P>
<P>If it's not something I do, I'm not well-equipped to write about it,
 and so it behooves you to see where I have gone, and where I'm going,
 to decide whether my way of using this package bears any relevance to
 what you want to do with the software yourself. Most notably, I am not
 an audio guy, and I barely know anything about the subject. If you're
 dying to dig into some complex audio project, and you know what terms
 like &quot;DAW,&quot; &quot;ADAT,&quot; and &quot;MMC&quot; mean, then I'm afraid I will be of little
 help.</P>
<P>One might say that Rosegarden is my band in a box. I have precious
 little contact with musical people, and so I make heavy use of my
 computer as an accompanist in a variety of ways. I find that it is much
 more rewarding to play music with other people, even if those &quot;other
 people&quot; are actually me, or a synthesizer. When I'm not accompanying
 myself with other live instruments, I can take advantage of the vast
 array of MIDI files available on the internet as and endless source of
 material for fun projects. (Believe me, there's no other way I would
 ever get to play Bach. Real musicians would be too busy laughing at me
 to play their parts. :)</P>
<P>I involve a wide variety of source materials in these projects, but
 for the purpose of this guide, I will stick with completely original
 compositions, so as to avoid any potential copyright issues. They may
 not be<I> good</I> compositions, but I own the rights to them, and can
 mangle them any way I choose without fear of any consequence more dire
 than rotten food being thrown at my head.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="1_5">1.5 The Author's Studio</A></H2>
<P>Obviously, what I can actually demonstrate is hardware dependant. I'd
 like you to bear in mind what is sitting in front of me as I write
 this, and thus I will share the details of my &quot;studio.&quot;</P>
<P>I'm running a 1.0 GHz Athlon system with 256 MB of RAM. The box runs
 Debian Woody with aftermarket KDE 3.0.3 from a third-party apt-source,
 and a variety of other add-ons that I've had to compile for myself
 along the way in order to get my build environment in line for bleeding
 edge software such as Rosegarden. I'm running a completely stock kernel
 2.4.19 that has had no patches applied. (I probably should look at
 latency tuning, but I am leery, and have thus far avoided it. I enjoy
 stabilty, and am not keen on giving applications the authority to
 trample all over my kernel.)</P>
<P>On the audio side of things, my sole soundcard is a Sound Blaster PCI
 128, driven by ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and Jack from CVS, with Woody's supplied
 LADSPA SDK and plugins.</P>
<P>On the MIDI side of things, I have a joystick port MIDI box for the
 Sound Blaster, to which I attach a Fatar MIDI-72 controller keyboard
 and a Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas. All of the source MIDI files that I
 work with in this guide were sequenced to make use of this particular
 GS synth, and as such, some of what I say in that area will not apply
 or even make sense to you if you're using an XG or other type of synth
 to follow along.</P>
<P>In addition to the Roland, I'm running an IWU Soft Synth via
 iiwusynth 0.2.2. Details of getting these working successfully are
 covered in the<A HREF="http://faq.html/"> FAQ.</A> I have it compiled
 against Jack, but have not yet managed to actually get the two to
 co-exist, so I run one or the other, depending on what I want to do
 with Rosegarden.</P>
<P>I run Rosegarden from CVS, which I build pretty much every day. As of
 this writing, the latest stable version is Rosegarden-4 0.8.5, but that
 version is very old.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>TIP: You might want to consider
 running Rosegarden from a command line so you can see what's going on
 behind the GUI. What's gibberish to you may be a great help to the

 watch it working behind the scenes when it's too busy processing a
 particularly large bit of data to bother repainting its window.</I></FONT>

 begin with an imported MIDI file, it all starts with a<B> Segment</B>,
 which is a convenient container that stores a bit of note data or
 audio. Segments can be cut, pasted, split, re-combined, overlapped and
 pretty much rearranged at will, and are very flexible.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">By now,
 you're probably wondering when we're going to do something useful, so
 let's go take a look at the<B> Studio</B>.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_4">2.4 The Studio</A></H2>
<P>Before importing anything into Rosegarden, we're going to want to set
 up instrument definitions for all of our MIDI devices so that any bank
 changes don't get lost in the translation. If there's no
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 instrument
 definition for a particular program/bank change, then information will
 disappear at import time and the file will be interpreted as pure
 General MIDI. (This is of little consequence if you only use General
 MIDI, but setting things up in advance will save you from having to
 tweak any imported GS, XG or other device-specific files to correct the
 lost program changes.)</P>
<P>The<B> Studio</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
, which resides on the<B> Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI
 Devices...</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 menu,<B></B> is where all of this is accomplished, and
 it's your interface for relating to one of Rosegarden's most unusual
 features. Hopefully I can shed some light and help you to make use of
 this very important and heavily misunderstood feature.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: This facility was only recently added to
 Rosegarden. If you're not running at least version 0.8.5, you'll need
 to upgrade to 0.8.5 or CVS before you can make use of these features.
 If this chapter is completely baffling to you, check your version.</I></FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5">2.5 Instruments, Banks and Devices</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Before you can accomplish anything with
 the<B> Studio</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
, you need to understand what a<B> device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 is. A<B>
 device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
, simply stated, is a data structure that contains up to

 of instrument definitions.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A<B> device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 is a Rosegarden
 construct, a storage container, that has absolutely no correlation to
 the term &quot;device&quot; as you might apply it in a context like &quot;MIDI
 device,&quot; referring to something like your Aunt Matilda's MIDI piano, or
 &quot;MIDI device&quot; referring to your MPU-401 card or your soundcard's
 on-board synthesizer. It's best if you treat<B> device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 in
 Rosegarden's context as though it were a false cognante (<I>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
les faux
 amis</I>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"-->
) in a foreign language. It looks like English, and sounds like
 English, but no English language dictionary definition of this term
 will help you to understand the language of Rosegarden.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
In Rosegarden parlance, a<B> device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 is a construct that<B></B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 contains up to numerous<B> banks</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 of<B>
 instrument definitions</B> that are attached to a particular set of
 ports. If you have only one MIDI device, and it doesn't support
 anything more than the basic General MIDI instrument set, then the<B>
 device</B> need only contain one<B> bank</B> with a single set of
 instrument definitions<B></B> attached to your only port
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
, and you're in
 luck, because that's how Rosegarden comes configured out of the box.
 You can skip ahead to something more interesting, and save yourself a
 headache.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If, on the other hand, you have two
 soundcards with a MIDI port each, and you're also using an IIWU Soft
 Synth, your<B> device</B> might contain several<B> banks</B> of<B>
 instrument definitions</B>, and you need to sit down and read a bit.
 People with anything more than the most rudimentary MIDI setup should
 probably go grab a snack, strap on their thinking caps, then read on.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_6">2.6
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 No Global Instrument Definitions</A>
</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Every native Rosegarden composition (<B>
.rg</B>) file contains a<B> device</B>, along with note events and other
 types of data. It's a good idea to configure your<B> device</B> early
 on, because anything you save with incorrect instrument definitions
 will need to be corrected later. It's not absolutely critical, because
 there's also a special subset of the Rosegarden format that stores just
 the definition for a<B> device</B> in a file with an<B> .rgd</B>
 extension, and it's possible to load all or part of the<B></B>
 instrument definitions these files contain into existing compositions.
 However, the sooner you get things configured, the less work you'll
 need to do later.</P>
<P>Unlike most other programs, there are no global<B> device</B>
 settings. Everything is done on a per-file basis, and the<B> device</B>
 definition remains bound up with each individual composition,
 presenting special concerns when you want to share your work with other
 people who have different setups. It is not possible to set up a
 definition of your hardware only once, and have anything that you
 subsequently load fit itself into that mold automatically; instead you
 must manually adjust each file you load. This is probably a strength
 for those who load a different soundfont for every composition, if they
 can keep track of which soundfont to load for which, but I could be
 quite confusing for users of more conventional MIDI gear whose
 available instruments never change.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: The<B> device</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 contains instrument
 definitions for every MIDI device (port) that was available at the time
 the composition was created It's possible for a composition to contain
 hidden definitions for unavailable MIDI devices,
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 which magically
 re-appear when the port is once again visible to Rosegarden.</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>TIP: To approximate

 all of your synthesizers and save it to

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If none of the<B> devices</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 in the<B>
 library</B> fit, you can use one of them as a starting point for
 rolling your own, or you can build one from scratch. In order to do
 that effectively, you need to determine your synth's implementation.
 Most MIDI synths have a &quot;Tone Table&quot; in the manual somewhere. If you're
 using a soft synth or some other device that allows random,
 user-specified instrument assignments, then you'll have to figure out
 what to call the instruments that are available using various
 combinations of program and bank changes for yourself.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The first step is to determine how your
 synth handles bank changes, so you can assign numbers to either the<B>
 LSB</B> or<B> MSB</B> parameters. I'm not sure what those names
 actually mean, but trial and error will get you there. It turns out
 that Roland GS uses the<B> MSB</B> for everything, but your mileage is
 almost guaranteed to vary.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: Individual groups
 of names can only be assigned to a single<B> LSB/MSB</B> combination,
 so this can present problems. When I created the<B> GS</B>

 bank, I had
 to compromise. Roland didn't do consistent things with how types of
 variations were available via particular bank change numbers, and there
 was no way to keep everything completely logical. Consequently, there
 are some oddities, such as melodic instruments in bank &quot;FX 1.&quot; I named
 the banks the best way I could figure, using the mechanism Rosegarden
 provides, but I'm not completely happy with the result.</I></FONT></P>
<P>Once you've decided what your instrument definition needs to contain,

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_2">3.2 Transport Tools</A></H2>

 two of the tools we'll use to get around in our compositions.</P>
<P>Notice that there's a vertical blue bar in the<B> Segment Pane</B> of

 to any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along the dark

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="198" NAME="Graphic31"

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Transport Window" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="161"
NAME="Graphic2" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m41d8a9c.png" WIDTH="428"></P>
<P>Most of these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out
 what any of the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and
 context-sensitive help will pop up.</P>
<P>Of special note are the<B> Panic</B>,<B> Metronome</B>,<B></B> and<B>

<P>The<B> Panic</B> button transmits an &quot;all notes off&quot; message. Use it,
 for example, when your synth has gotten a note stuck and the incessant
 droning of that low F# is driving you up the wall.</P>
<P>The<B> Metronome</B> does what you'd probably expect. You can turn
 the metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it
 is a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
 composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The<B> Solo</B> button mutes all tracks
 except for the one that's currently selected, allowing you a convenient
 way to hear just one part. (To &quot;solo&quot; more than one part, at present,
 you'll need to set the mute for tracks individually. The<B> Solo</B>
 button only affects a single track.)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_3">3.3 Tweaking the Import</A></H2>
<P>Find the<B> Play/Pause</B> button and give this composition a listen.
 It's very likely that it will sound somewhat lame initially. That's the
 result of a few issues that Rosegarden needs a bit of help to work
 around.</P>
<P>This file was created with Cakewalk, and it includes a SysEx bank
 that would have set up the reverb level and various other paremeters on
 my synth. That has been lost. It includes percussion on two separate
 channels, which is why you're hearing those raunchy piano notes in the
 bass (that track was assigned to channel 9), and it's supposed to use
 the &quot;OrcheSet&quot; drum kit on my synth. The program change on channel 10
 was lost.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, before you write me off as a terrible composer,
 let's get this back to the condition it was in when it left Cakewalk
 last year. We need to correct for what has been lost in the translation
 from raw MIDI to Rosegarden's internal format, and then we'll play with
 it.</P>
<P>The first thing we really need to do is fix the percussion. The most
 direct way to accomplish this is to assign the &quot;Conga&quot; track to the
 same device and channel as the previous track.</P>
<P>Click on the &quot;Conga&quot; track name, and hold the button down for a
 moment. Navigate through the various available devices until you find
 channel 10. Your results will vary depending on a number of variables,
 but here's what it looks like here:<I> (Note that the &quot;Dummy MIDI
 Device&quot; will hopefully change into something more useful soon.)</I></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG BORDER="0" HEIGHT="319" NAME="Graphic49" SRC="fix-conga.png"
WIDTH="450"></P>
<P>Now, we really need to change the drum kit. As I mentioned in the<B>
 Studio</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 chapter, Rosegarden can't yet cope with having GS-style
 named drumkits on channel 10. It's on the table, but no decision has
 yet been made as to exactly how best to implement it. Until then, we'll
 have to live with having an instrument listed instead of our drumkit.</P>
<P>I jumped the gun in taking the above snapshot. Note that I have
 already assigned the &quot;Strings&quot; program to this channel. It so happens
 that &quot;Strings&quot; corresponds to the correct program number I need to use
 in order to switch my Sound Canvas to the &quot;OrcheSet&quot; drum kit.</P>
<P>In order for you to do the same at home, click on either the &quot;Conga&quot;
 or the &quot;Orchestral bass, crash &amp; snare&quot; track name to select it.
 (Remember that they're both bound to the same device and channel, so a
 change made to one will affect the other.) Now click on the<B> Program</B>
 button in the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> pane.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="249" NAME="Graphic50"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m21c39b4a.png" WIDTH="175"></P>
<P>If the<B> Program</B> checkbox isn't checked, check it. Now you can
 scroll through with your mouse wheel, or select a name from the
 drop-down list. It's helpful if your synth has a display so that you
 can see when you happen to get to the correct program number. In this
 case, &quot;Strings&quot; in the &quot;Capital Tones&quot; bank is what we're after.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="dropdown list" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="202"
NAME="Graphic5" SRC="dropdown.png" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Of course your mileage with all of this
 will surely vary depending on your synth. You may not have the option
 of changing this at all, or may need to use a completely different
 method for changing it. XG users, I've learned, will need to use bank,
 rather than program changes, to change drum kits. Soft synth users and
 others who can make use of them will probably want to load an
 appropriate soundfont. Something medievalish would be tasty. Season to
 to suit yourself.</P>
<P>Now that the drums are a little more interesting, it's starting to
 sound better, but there's still work to do. We need to make up for that
 lost SysEx bank by cranking up the reverb.</P>

 knobs in this pane.</P>

 in a straight horizontal or vertical line (don't try to drag it around

 never have too much reverb. Now lather, rinse, repeat until every track
 has major 'verbage. (Or reverbificate to taste, if you insist on having
 less than maximal 'verbage...)</P>

<P><I>As always, &quot;save early, save often&quot; is the mantra of computer
 users everywhere. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your
 work, but Rosegarden tries to save you from yourself.</I></P>

 because this feature doesn't officially exist yet. You'll<B> only</B>
 find it in CVS.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a
 power outage or the like, the next time you start Rosegarden and
 attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll be presented with
 the option of loading the autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet
 saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory with a
 basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</I></P>

<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4">4 Let's Edit Some Notation</A></H1>
<P>For the next phase in our sample project, we want to look at what is
 necessary to make the flute part in this composition playable on a real
 flute, and then print a score. In this chapter, we'll make some basic
 changes to the part and work on cleaning up the humanized performance
 data so that it renders as more tidy notes. Later on, in Chapter 5,
 we'll add some new material to this part to make it more exciting to
 play.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_1">4.1 Opening the Notation

<P>Let's get a look at what this part looks like in notation. It will
 probably be ugly, since I recorded it on my keyboard instead of
 entering it note by note.</P>
<P>Let's open the<B> Notation Editor</B> and have a look. Highlight a

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="88" NAME="Graphic52"

 choosing &quot;<B>Edit as Notation</B>&quot; from the context submenu. You can
 also configure this to be your default view via<B> Settings -&gt;

 get to the<B> Notation Editor</B> by merely double-clicking the desired
 segment.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_2">4.2 Notation Editor Overview</A></H2>
<P>We'll be spending a lot of time here in the<B> Notation Editor</B>.
 As you'd expect, this is where you go to view and edit your data as
 standard notation. This editor has many more features than I will make
 use of for my purposes here, but this should be enough of an
 introduction for you to get wherever you want to be with your own
 projects.</P>
<P>The first thing you'll notice is that there are different toolbars
 here. Before looking, let's synchronize our displays. You may not yet
 have a<B> Transport Toolbar</B> for this window. Check<B> Settings -&gt;
 Show Transport Toolbar</B> and the<B> Transport Toolbar</B> should
 appear. It would be a good idea to use<B> Settings -&gt; Save Settings</B>
 at this point so that it remains there, as it's very useful.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now, let's have a look at the new

<P>The<B> Transport Toolbar</B> that we turned on in the preceding

 exceptions, which is why I've saved it until now. These extra buttons
 are useful for controlling playback when the<B> Playback Pointer</B> is

 working on.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="28" NAME="Graphic54"

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you haven't moved it, the<B> Playback Pointer</B> is
 at or near the beginning of the composition. This part doesn't come in
 until much later, so if we hit the<B> Play</B> button now, we can't
 expect to hear anything for awhile.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The<B> Notation Editor</B>
 has its own cursor, which is just like the one in the<B> Segment Pane</B>

 control playback, you need to be able to manipulate both cursors, and
 those two extra buttons on the end of the toolbar help you do just
 that.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's move the playback cursor to the

<P>Notice the<B> Size</B>,<B> Spacing</B>, and<B> Smoothing</B> sliders.
 (They're camera shy for some reason, and come out black. I'm sure
 you'll have no problem figuring out what I'm talking about.)</P>
<P>The<B> Size</B> slider changes the size of the font used to render
 the notes.</P>
<P>The<B> Spacing</B> slider can be used to adjust the horizontal
 spacing of the notes, to draw them closer or further apart. Useful for
 spreading out particularly complicated rhythms for easier reading.</P>
<P>The<B> Smoothing</B> slider is useful for cleaning up performance

<P>All of these controls are also available from the<B> View</B> menu.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_3">4.3 Transposing</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now that we've had our bit of fun playing with all the

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="128" NAME="Graphic9"
SRC="notation-yucky-notes.png" WIDTH="467"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gack! This definitely should have been a piccolo part.
 My head hurts just looking at this stuff. Let's transpose it down an
 octave and see what it looks like. Let's make that<B> two</B> octaves!
 I can get that high with my flute, but my dog would hate me. Two

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_4">4.4 De-Humanizing</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now that we're down to a reasonable
 register, let's do something about the ugly notes. The problem with
 human performance data is that it doesn't scale well into notation.
 You'll notice that some of the notes are displaying in yellow. That's
 because they're notes whose timing and duration don't quite make sense
 to Rosegarden within the context of this measure, so it has colored
 them to let you know that the notes on the page are only an
 approximation of what will actually be played. To see a view of the
 data in a more pure format, use the<B> Matrix</B> or<B> Event List</B>
 editors, which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since our objective here is to make the
 notation more readable, we might as well remain here and alter the data
 until it better fits into place within the context of notation. In this
 instance, readability is more important to us than the faithful
 rendering of a human performance, so we're going to end up making
 &quot;physical&quot; changes to the data along the way.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_4_1">4.4.1 Smoothing</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's start by seeing what that<B>
 Smoothing</B> slider can do for us... Each notch makes the rhythm
 progressively less obnoxious to read, leaving the notes in place.
 Adjust the slider, and see what results. I found that the final notch
 was too high, and the next lower notch was looking better, but wasn't
 really quite there.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's try making these smoothed values
 permanent. Select the whole staff, and let's try<B> Transform -&gt; Fix
 Smoothed Values</B>...</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="123" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="using-rosegarden_html_829041d.png" WIDTH="630"></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Well, that didn't quite have the desired
 effect, did it? The timings are still too far off. Remember<B> ctrl-Z</B>
 is a shortcut for<B> Edit -&gt; Undo</B>.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="western"><A NAME="4_4_2">4.4.2 Quantize</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I think this data is so messy that we're
 going to have to quantize it. Let's<B> Undo</B> that last change, and
 play with<B> Transform -&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's tell it to<B>
 Quantize: Event positions, and round durations to exact notes</B>.
 We'll leave the<B> Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>, and
 accept the default<B> Note rounding</B> values and see where that gets
 us:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="250" NAME="Graphic13"

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Not too bad. It's looking much better:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="128" NAME="Graphic18" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_799bfde7.png" WIDTH="466">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Let's see how those changes
 sound, and then we'll see about turning those 16<SUP>th</SUP> note/rest
 pairs into something a little easier to read...</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The quantized notes seem to
 have fallen into place along sane boundaries without having an undue
 impact on the rhythm or feel of the piece. Bearing that in mind, let's
 back up a step and see what would have happened if we had quantized on
 8<SUP>th</SUP> note boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B> Edit -&gt;
 Undo</B>, then run through the<B> Transformations -&gt; Quantize</B>
 dialog again, specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP> note this
 time around.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Very nice indeed, and
 Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes and other odd bits
 as required, ignoring the base duration when it really had to. That's
 one of the best jobs of quantization I've seen in a notation editor.
 There won't be much clean-up to do from here:</P>

<P>Printing is currently a bit of an ugly thing in Rosegarden, which

<P>The current design plan calls for a rudimentary print facility

 draft printing, combined with off-loading the task onto an external
 utility for high quality printing.</P>
<P>In current practice, the output quality of this &quot;draft&quot; printing is
 usually very poor. You can probably put dead trees to better use than
 this, and I don't recommend using it for anything more than the most
 trivial of jobs.

<P>Rosegarden has no built-in facility for editing audio. Instead, it
 provides a mechanism for you to configure an external editor, via<B>
 Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden</B>

 on the<B> External Editors</B>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can browse to your
 editor of choice via the<B> Choose...</B>

 button, or type the name of
 the executable. My personal preference is for Audacity (<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</A>), which I really like, but there
 are many suitable editors available.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_2">5.2 Importing Existing Audio</A></H2>
<P>There are two ways to get audio into Rosegarden. If you wish to
 import projects that you have been working on with some other
 application, you can import the audio files and insert them into your
 composition. The heart of this facility is the<B> Segments -&gt; Manage
 Audio Segments...</B>

 divider:</P>

 select audio files for insertion into your compositions:</P>

HEIGHT="286" NAME="Graphic61" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m4e2b1e73.png" WIDTH="773">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Using this is fairly
 straightforward. Use the<B> Add Audio File</B> button to pick a file,
 which will then appear in the list. I'll just grab some .wav files that
 I have handy, since I haven't actually recorded anything related to
 this composition:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once the files are loaded,
 some statistics are printed, and a brief preview appears. You can us
 the<B> Play Preview</B> button to hear what you've got.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: If
 the<B> Play Preview</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 button is grayed out, as in the above example,
 it probably means that either Rosegarden wasn't compiled with audio
 features enabled, or else your audio server is not running. In my case,
 I forgot to run Jack before starting Rosegarden.</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Once you're satisfied that
 you've selected the correct files, you can insert them into your
 composition one by one with the<B> Insert into Composition</B> button.
 Let's insert &quot;rouen.wav&quot; and make both Dave Barry and Guillaume Laurent
 proud:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Newly-inserted audio
 segments go into a new track of their own, and it's always appended to
 the bottom of the<B> Tracklist</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>TIP: If
 you're working on a newly-created composition, rather than one that is
 based on a MIDI import, it will start with a large number of tracks. It
 may appear that nothing happened after you hit the<B> Insert into
 Composition...</B> button. Scroll down to the bottom, and you should
 see a new track with your audio segment inserted.</I></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_3">5.3
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 Recording</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">It is possible to record directly into
 Rosegarden. First you'll want to point the track to a Jack source in
 the same fashion used to assign tracks to MIDI devices.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="394" NAME="Graphic76" SRC="using-rosegarden_html_m1bb3bee5.png" WIDTH="386">
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: I honestly have
 no idea what JACK Audio #0 through #15 mean.</I></FONT></P>
<P>Now if the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="17" NAME="Graphic77"
SRC="record-button.png" WIDTH="16"> button is toggled for the track,
 making it the destination for record operations, any signal on the
 mixer channel you've selected as the record source (via KMix or the
 like) should be recorded, and should wind up in an audio segment.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>NOTE: The one time I tried that, it didn't work
 very well, and I haven't tried to do it since. I'm not sure whether or
 not this is actually supposed to work. I need to play with that, but at
 this writing I am quickly running out of time, and want to get this out
 the door. I don't currently have Jack working, and don't have time to
 figure out why it's broken.</I></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5_4">5.4 Manipulating Audio Segments</A></H2>
<P><I>Audio segments behave in the same fashion as segments containing
 notation data. You can drag them around, drag them from track to track,
 and so on. You can split them, move bits of them around. I don't have
 time to show you any of that at this writing. I need to go to work, and
 I want to get this published before I go.</I></P>
<P><I>I plan to:</I></P>
<P><I> check on recording</I></P>
<P><I> find out what jack #0  15 mean</I></P>
<P><I> explain how to use Edit Audio and Auto-Split Audio</I></P>
<P><I> do a real project with a mixture of MIDI and audio</I></P>
<P><I> demonstrate the use of LADSPA plugins</I></P>
<P><I> ???</I></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6">6 That's All, Folks...</A></H1>
<P>That's all I've had time to do to date. There are many more topics I
 wish to treat eventually, but there are so many developments in the
 works at the time of this writing that I'm just as well off to hold
 back, to reduce the amount of material I will have to adapt to suit
 changing future realities. I've already written about far too many
 features that are only available in CVS as it is.</P>
<P>I hope what you've seen has given you ideas for projects that<B> you</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 can do with Rosegarden. If I've left something that's very important to
 you out, please feel free to send me a note at<A HREF="mailto:dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net">
 dmmcintyr@users.sourceforge.net</A> and I will try to accommodate your
 need and discuss it sooner.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="arial">I
 have mentioned elsewhere that Rosegarden is not purely a MIDI
 sequencer, and that it is not possible to create or manage raw MIDI
 events directly. Neither is it purely a notation editor. Applications
 dedicated to notation typically work with notation internally, and any
 MIDI performance capability they have is the result of interpreting
 that notation and translating it into MIDI. These applications
 typically do a rudimentary job at best, and the results almost always
 sound very artificial and mechanical. At the other extreme,
 applications dedicated entirely to MIDI sequencing tend to have
 rudimentary notation capabilities, and it is often all but impossible
 to produce legible notation with these unless the MIDI data itself has
 been beaten into a state of mechanical purity that causes the results
 to sound just as artificial as that produced by dedicated notation
 packages.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="arial">
Rosegarden sits squarely in the middle between these two extremes,
 possessing most of the features of both, with few compromises. In order
 to allow the richness of a human performance to coexist with legible
 notation, every note event, whether recorded, imported, or entered by
 hand, contains not one, but two different duration properties. One
 duration is used to determine how long the note will sound for MIDI
 performance, while the other is used for displaying clean, legible
 notation. This exciting feature makes Rosegarden the only application I
 know that allows you to have your cake and eat it too.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_1">8.1 Notation Editor Overview</A></H2>
<P>In order to open the notation editor, you must have at least one
 segment available. You can open any number of segments on any number of
 tracks simultaneously by selecting the segment or segments you wish to
 edit, and then right clicking on one of them and choosing &quot;Open in
 Notation Editor&quot; from the context menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic1"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-open-in-notation-editor.png" ></P>
<P>Additionally, the notation editor is the normal default, so you can
 also open it either by pressing<B> Enter</B>, or by double clicking on
 a segment. (You can configure this behavior from<B> Settings -&gt;
 Configure Rosegarden</B>.)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic2"

<P>After you have opened it, you will see something a bit like this.

 particular example is in multiple page layout mode, which is not the
 default.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_1_1">8.1.1 Notation Toolbars</A></H3>
<P>The notation editor is just bristling with toolbars big and small. I
 will defer many of them until time to describe their function in more
 detail.</P>
<P>The standard toolbar includes print and save icons, as well as the
 usual cut/copy/paste tools.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic4" SRC="../pixmaps/notation-toolbar.png"

<P>The tools toolbar has several of the same tools found in the main
 window, but it adds icons for step recording and the quantizer.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The layout
 toolbar allows you to change the way notation is displayed in various
 ways. You can switch between linear layout mode, continuous page mode,
 and multiple page mode. The linear mode scrolls continuously off to the
 right, and it is the only mode that has rulers. The continuous page
 mode displays notation formatted as though it were a printed page, but
 it scrolls continuously toward the bottom. Multiple page mode breaks
 the notation into discrete pages, and provides a pager to allow you to
 get access to the portion of the wish to view or edit.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">You can use
 the<B> Font:</B> combo box to choose among the standard Feta (courtesy
 of the Lilypond project), a bitmap version of Feta called &quot;Feta

 Rosegarden, called &quot;RG21.&quot; The<B> Size:</B> box functions somewhat like
 the zoom slider in the other views, allowing you to magnify or reduce
 your view (but not your printouts or exports.) The<B> Spacing:</B> box
 allows you tweak how much space Rosegarden uses when laying out the
 notation horizontally.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_2">8.2 Opening Multiple Staffs</A></H2>
<P>Many posters on the rosegarden-user mailing list use Rosegarden to
 work with piano notation, so I have chosen a simple flute with piano
 accompaniment arrangement as the place in which to demonstrate various
 entry and editing features.</P>
<P>I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter that Rosegarden has
 made few compromises in order to be able to do a bang up job as both a
 notation editor and a MIDI sequencer. This example also serves to
 highlight one of those compromises. It is not possible to display an
 entire piano part on one grand staff. Neither is it possible to do a
 good, clear job of writing multiple parts or voices on the same staff.
 Due to both of these limitations, you will probably want to write the
 bass and treble parts in different segments, and thus on separate
 staffs. These segments can be in the same track, but if they are
 exactly the same length, and they overlap each other exactly, it will
 be impossible to select whichever segment lies on the bottom. For this
 reason, I recommend putting the right and left hand parts on different
 tracks as well.</P>
<P>For this example, I have created three segments on three tracks. I've
 labeled the top one &quot;flute&quot; and have assigned it to a device and
 instrument that will play a flute program on channel 1. The remaining
 two tracks are labeled by right or left hand, and they are both
 assigned to the same piano instrument, which will play using a piano
 program on channel 2. I have selected all three of these segments in
 order to open them in a combined notation view:</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3">8.3 Notation Basics</A></H2>
<P>Unless you have changed the default notation display mode, the
 notation view should open in its default linear layout mode, like this:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic18"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-empty-segments-editing.png" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_1">8.3.1 Notation Rulers</A></H3>
<P>Just like the matrix view, there are two distinct sets of rulers
 here. At the top of the window you will find a tempo ruler, a special
 raw note ruler, which I will describe later on, and an an insertion
 ruler for manipulating the insertion cursor. The insertion cursor
 determines the point at which notation elements are inserted.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic11"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rules.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In a multiple staff situation such as this, you will
 notice that the insertion cursor only spans a single staff. This lets
 you know which staff is the active target for various operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>NOTE: The tempo ruler here in the notation view is
 provide for reference only. Tempo must be edited from the main window.</I>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_2">8.3.2 Clefs</A></H3>
<P>There are at least two ways to enter a clef. Regardless of which you
 use, you first need to position the insertion cursor at the correct
 insertion point, if it isn't there already. Select the target staff by
 double clicking on it. Then you can use<B> Segment -&gt; Add Clef Change</B>
 from the menu. A clef chooser dialog will appear, allowing you to
 choose from a variety of different clefs in different<I> 8va</I>
 configurations by clicking on the various arrows. The up/down arrows
 change between<I> 8</I> and<I> 16va</I> up or down, respectively, and
 the left/right arrows cycle through the various available clefs. The
 dialog will remember the clef you used last time, making it more
 convenient to insert multiple clefs. (There is no option to insert a
 clef in more than one place at once, so you will have to add a clef to
 each staff manually.)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The<B> Existing notes following clef
 change</B> portion of this dialog is particularly useful in a situation
 where you began entering notation before choosing a clef. Rosegarden
 thinks in treble, and treble is the default if no clef is present. If<B>
 [x] Transpose into appropriate octave</B> is selected, Rosegarden will
 attempt to find the best transposition of any existing notation
 relative to the new clef. (If this has undesired consequences, as it
 sometimes does, then you can transpose again by hand, as I will discuss
 in due course.)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic22"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clef-dialog.png" ></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you prefer, you can use the Clefs
 toolbar. (The Clefs toolbar is not toggled on by default.)</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic9" SRC="../pixmaps/notation-clefs-toolbar.png"
></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">To use the toolbar, first switch to the <IMG

> cursor, then select one of the clefs from the Clefs toolbar.
 Click in one of the staffs, and the selected clef should be inserted.
 If you find a dead zone near the time signature, you may need to click
 around a bit until you find the magic spot.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_2_1">8.3.2.1 Key Signatures</A></H4>
<P>Key signatures are added in a similar fashion to clefs. Position the
 insertion cursor as appropriate, select the target staff, and then use<B>
 Segment -&gt; Add Key Change</B> from the menu. You will be presented with
 a dialog that allows you to choose from all major and minor keys up
 through seven accidentals.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic23"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-key-signature-dialog.png" ></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In addition to changing the key signature
 itself, you can use the<B> Scope</B> controls to change whether
 Rosegarden will insert the new key signature only in the target staff,
 or in all staffs (segments) at this point in time. You may also decide
 whether Rosegarden should favor the existing pitches, possibly creating
 new accidentals in the new key, or favor the current accidentals, which
 might change the pitches in the new key. Rosegarden can also attempt to
 transpose the notation into the new key.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_3">8.3.3 Tempo and Time Signature</A></H3>
<P>Both of these are attributes of the composition as a whole, and it is
 not possible to have a different tempo or time signature in different
 segments. These attributes can be controlled from the main window, but
 they can also be edited from the notation view for convenience.</P>
<P>I already discussed the associated dialogs for both of these in<A HREF="chapter-3.html">
 Chapter 3</A>. To open the tempo and time signature editor, double
 click on the tempo ruler, or on a time signature.</P>
<P>If you wish, for example, to insert a time signature change from 4/4
 to 12/8 at bar 3, move the insertion cursor (by clicking on the top
 ruler) to the appropriate time, then use<B> Composition -&gt; Add Time
 Signature Change</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 to open the time signature editor dialog.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

Notice in particular example that the measure following
 this one did not expand to become full after this change. Time
 signature adjustments will not resize segments. Instead, the beats are

 one with five and one with three.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_4">8.3.4 Entering Notes and Rests</A></H3>
<P>Rosegarden provides a variety of ways to enter notes, providing tools
 for both mouse- and keyboard-oriented composers. Perhaps the quickest
 way to get started is to use the several associated toolbars and point
 and click a few notes into existence. (I will cover the other methods a
 bit later on.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_4_1">8.3.4.1 Notes</A></H4>
<P>Switch to the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic24"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" > tool, which puts the editor
 into insert mode. To enter a note, choose either a standard or a dotted
 duration from the Notes toolbar. Then click in one of the staffs to
 insert a note at that location.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-notes-toolbar.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic25"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note.png" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_4_2">8.3.4.2 Rests</A></H4>
<P>Rests are treated as negative space, and Rosegarden attempts to pad
 out the measure with rests automatically. However, it is often useful,
 even necessary, to enter them manually. For example, switch to the 8<SUP>
th</SUP> note duration and then try to enter an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on
 the far side of that quarter rest, leaving an 8<SUP>th</SUP> rest in
 between. It's impossible. You'll wind up with a result like this every
 time:</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic26" SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note1.png"
></P>
<P>The trick to this is to manually insert a rest, which causes
 Rosegarden to subdivide the beat; giving you a place to insert your new
 note. To change this note into a rest, select an appropriate duration
 from the Rests toolbar, then click on the note head to replace it with
 a rest.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic17"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-rests-toolbar.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic27"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note2.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now you can change to an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the
 Notes toolbar and enter the remaining note in the correct location.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic28"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note3.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice as you do this that the insertion cursor advances
 to the next beat division. Remember that you can reposition it using
 the insertion ruler. What you cannot do, however, is move it to an
 arbitrary point in time. It always snaps along beat divisions,
 depending on how the measure is divided, and it can sometimes be a bit
 fiddling getting a not just where you want it. Particularly if you're
 adding a new note to existing notation, as when turning a single note
 into a chord, for example.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_4_3">8.3.4.3 Chords</A></H4>
<P>When using the toolbars and other graphical tools to insert notes,
 creating chords is as simple as clicking in a new note above or below
 an existing one.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic14"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-enter-first-note4.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can also select a series of notes spaced out over

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic29"

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can transpose individual notes or entire selections

<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8_3_4_6">8.3.4.6 Avoiding Multiple Voices</A>
</H4>
<P>Rosegarden cannot handle situations involving multiple musical lines
 written on the same staff very well at all. From a MIDI performance
 perspective, there is no reason why you cannot have an entire violin
 concerto in a single segment, and you can manipulate this data to your
 heart's content with the other editors, but the notation editor will
 never produce good results attempting to interpret data like this into
 legible notation. It attempts to display the notation as a single line,
 and this can lead to a great deal of awkwardness. For example, select a
 dotted 8<SUP>th</SUP> note duration from the Notes toolbar and then add
 a note above the first quarter note. Rosegarden splits and ties the
 quarter note and displays the whole mess as a chord.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic31" SRC="../pixmaps/notation-counterpoint.png"
></P>
<P>You can undo this if you do so immediately, but if you wish to go
 back later on and erase the top note, the bottom note will remain a
 split-and-tied pair permanently, because it has become two separate
 events.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic32"

<P>If you have some particular reason why you would prefer not to change

 badly-rendered sample slur. You can re-position virtually any notation
 element to take matters into your own hands and give things a nudge
 when required. Simply select the element or elements you wish to
 reposition, hold down the shift key, then drag them wherever you want.
 Their new positions will be remembered, stored with the composition,
 and printed, although this micro-positioning is not exportable to
 external notation formats like Lilypond.</P>
<P>You can take this to ridiculous extremes if you wish. I'll show you
 one example of a way to work around one of Rosegarden's limitations by
 taking advantage of the no-holds-barred nature of this feature later
 on, but it is not usually terribly useful to abuse your power to this
 degree:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic41"
SRC="../pixmaps/notation-select-for-slur2.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">However, when used in a reasonable fashion, this gives

<P>Someone asked me how he could use Rosegarden to notate Roman numerals
 to indicate intervals or chord progressions. While there is no facility
 specifically for this purpose, chord names work perfectly well, as they
 are just mid-sized Roman text printed above the staff. Here I have
 marked of the I IV V of a typical rock chord progression.</P>

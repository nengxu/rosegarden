Rosegarden has what might well be the most capable notation editor ever
 found in a MIDI sequencer. Typically, applications which do the best
 job of notation are dedicated entirely to that pursuit, and they have
 very limited, rudimentary MIDI capabilities. On the other side of that
 coin, applications which do the best job as MIDI sequencers often have
 extremely poor notation editors. Rosegarden straddles these two
 extremes very well, and its notation editor packs quite a surprising
 amount of punch.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="arial">
One of the most striking features is the fact that Rosegarden maintains
 both a display duration and a performance duration for every note.
 Users typically have to make a hard choice between a human performance
 and legible notation. I myself am certainly no stranger to the practice
 of maintaining both a quantized and an un-quantized version of a piece
 in separate tracks or separate files. Rosegarden allows you to have the
 best of both worlds, maintaining legible notation and human performance
 within the very same set of events.</FONT></P>

<P>In order to open the notation editor, you must have at least one
 segment available. You can open any number of segments on any number of
 tracks simultaneously by selecting the segment or segments you wish to
 edit, and then right clicking on one of them and choosing &quot;Open in
 Notation Editor&quot; from the context menu.</P>

<P>Additionally, the notation editor is the normal default, so you can
 also open it either by pressing<B> Enter</B>, or by double clicking on
 a segment. (You can configure this behavior from<B> Settings -&gt;
 Configure Rosegarden</B>.)</P>

<P>After you have opened it, you will see something a bit like this.
 Your screen will probably vary somewhat, because this particular
 example is in multi-page layout mode.</P>

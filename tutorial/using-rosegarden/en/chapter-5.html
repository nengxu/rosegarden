 View</H1>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">So far, we've only looked at the
 main window, and have not really edited anything. Rosegarden provides
 three different editors, each with its own unique view of the data. You
 can view the raw Rosegarden events with the Event List Editor, you can
 work with a piano roll metaphor with the Matrix Editor, or you can see
 your data as notation with the Notation Editor. Each of these editors
 works on a segment level, so you must have at least one segment
 selected in order to open one. If you wish to start with an editor from
 scratch, you must first create an empty segment with the pencil tool,
 as I described in chapter 2, and then select it.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_1">5.1 The Event List Editor</A></H2>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">Out of the box, the Notation
 Editor is the default, but that is a chapter unto itself. For the
 moment, let us begin with the simplest of the three. Pick a segment,
 and then right click on it. Choose &quot;Open in Event List Editor&quot; from the
 resulting context menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">Explaining its use is
 definitely best reserved for the future 500-page deluxe edition of this
 book. For the moment, let us move on to something more useful.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_2">5.2 The Matrix Editor</A></H2>
<P>The Matrix editor is based around the familiar piano roll metaphor
 you have probably seen in other packages. It is useful for taking a
 hands on approach to tweaking notes where their performance is more
 important than their visual appearance as notation. I find myself using
 the Matrix most often for two main purposes. It's my preferred method
 of sequencing percussion parts, and I use it to knock notes out of
 precise alignment on purpose; for example, when sequencing rolled
 chords in order to make a MIDI guitar sound more credible.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: The Matrix does not actually display raw MIDI events, and
 neither, for that matter, does the Event List. All editing operations
 in Rosegarden are done with Rosegarden events. Rosegarden events
 include things like pitch and duration, but they also include
 attributes like slashes, ties, slurs and so forth. The internal meta
 format these events take is more like music notation than pure MIDI.
 This is evident when viewing tied notes from the Matrix. You'd expect
 them to be one continuous note, but they are in fact discrete
 Rosegarden events, and they appear as such here.</I></P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_1">5.2.1 Overview</A></H3>
<P>Let's start with an empty segment one measure long, and I'll show you
 the basics. Draw your segment, select it, and then right click on it
 and choose
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 &quot;Open in Matrix Editor&quot; from the resulting context menu.
 You'll see something like this:</P>

<H3><A NAME="5_2_2">5.2.2 Entering New Notes</A></H3>
<P>Now let's do a little one bar loop for demonstration purposes. Just
 like on the main view, the pencil cursor <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="26"
NAME="Graphic65" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" WIDTH="27"> is
 used to create something new from scratch. In this case, of course,
 we're entering a note. Let's pepper this thing with a few well placed
 random pitches:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="128" NAME="Graphic5"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-new-notes.png" WIDTH="200"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You may have noticed that those came out as quarter
 notes. In order to control the default length of new notes, you must
 change the grid setting. Let's enter eight 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. First
 dial in the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the grid button:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="190" NAME="Graphic6"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-dial-grid.png" WIDTH="115"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now new notes you enter will take this duration by
 default:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="141" NAME="Graphic7"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-8th-notes.png" WIDTH="217"></P>
<P>It's obviously a bit tedious, but you can enter an entire composition
 this way if you desire.</P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_3">5.2.3 Adjusting Existing Notes</A></H3>
<P>You can move notes around with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="29"

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="158" NAME="Graphic9"

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can resize notes with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="142" NAME="Graphic10"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-notes.png" WIDTH="210"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">By default, resize operations snap to grid lines. If you
 wish to drag the note to some arbitrary length, do so by holding the
 shift key while dragging the note.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="113" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arbitrary-resize.png" WIDTH="212"></P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_4">5.2.4 Selecting and Acting on Multiple Notes</A></H3>
<P>All of these operations can be performed on more than one note at a
 time. In order to do so, you need to make a selection. You can use the <IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="27" NAME="Graphic13" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png"
WIDTH="27"> arrow cursor to select individual notes one by one while
 holding down the shift key.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="158" NAME="Graphic14"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-individual-notes.png" WIDTH="200"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you wish to select a broad range of notes, you can
 select every note of a given pitch by selecting the arrow cursor and
 shift clicking on the individual notes on the piano keyboard. Each
 click will select every note of the desired pitch, and you can select
 any number of pitches in this fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="136" NAME="Graphic15"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-pitch.png" WIDTH="203"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is also possible to select a band or several bands of
 notes by sweeping the arrow cursor across the keys while holding shift.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="138" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-sweep-selection.png" WIDTH="205"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, you can use my selection event filter to cull
 events from your selection. Start by making a broad selection, and then
 click on the filter icon to summon my dialog. You can then dial in
 various criteria for the notes you wish to remain selected after the
 filter is applied. (Yes,<B> my</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 selection event filter. I'm not just
 an author, I also pretend to know C++ on occasion. Please do let me
 know if you find it useful, or if there's anything you'd like added to
 it.)</P>

HEIGHT="254" NAME="Graphic17" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter.png" WIDTH="263"></P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_5">5.2.5 Velocity</A></H3>
<P>Velocity is a MIDI parameter that describes how hard a note was hit
 on the keyboard or other device. If you have a velocity sensistive
 keyboard, or if you enter notes from the notation editor, your notes
 should already have a velocity property attached. Notes you enter from
 here in the Matrix do not have any velocity at all by default.</P>
<H4>5.2.5.1 Showing the Velocity Ruler</H4>
<P>If the events you're editing have velocity properties, you can edit
 them with the Velocity Ruler. If it's not visible, turn it on from the
 View menu with<B> View -&gt; Show Velocity Property Ruler</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, all the events have a
 velocity of 100, and they show up as orange bars on the ruler.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="266" NAME="Graphic19" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-default-velocity-ruler.png" WIDTH="214">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">They can be changed by
 dragging them up and down, and the bars change colors to reflect their
 value. Here I've arranged them so that you can see each bar. Notice
 that the notes on the Matrix itself change to reflect these same
 colors.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="112" NAME="Graphic20" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arranged-velocity.png" WIDTH="167">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: It can indeed be
 somewhat tricky to know which note you're adjusting if there are
 several notes of the same duration at the same time. I truthfully have
 no idea if there is some trick to this to make managing the process
 more foolproof. If anyone knows, email me, and I will mention in the
 next edition.</I></P>
<H4>5.2.5.2 What If There's No Velocity Property?</H4>
<P>Sometimes note events are created without velocity properties. In
 that case, there will be nothing to see or do on the Velocity Ruler
 until you add some velocities. You'll need to select a range of notes
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->

 and then use<B> Adjust -&gt; Velocity -&gt; Set Event Velocities</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 to
 create some. This presents you with a dialog box that offers you
 several different options for how to set these up. The Value ranges
 from 0, which is the softest possible key strike, to 127, which is the
 most forceful.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<H3><A NAME="5_2_6">5.2.6 Controllers</A></H3>
<P>It's possible to transmit controllers from here in the matrix with
 the various Control Rulers. Let's add a Modulation ruler. Choose<B>
 View -&gt; Add Event Ruler -&gt; Modulation Controller</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 and you should now
 have a new tab at the bottom of your Matrix.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="121" NAME="Graphic21" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler.png" WIDTH="296"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you right click on the
 ruler you can insert a controller event, or even an entire line of
 them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="84" NAME="Graphic22" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler-line.png" WIDTH="145">
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, I have
 elected to insert a line of controllers. It's impossible to capture X
 cursors, so I must instead describe what I did. After making the
 selection from the menu, the cursor changed to a pointing finger. I
 picked a start point with this finger, and continued to hold the button
 down while dragging the resulting line up and to the right. It produced
 this line of controllers:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="112" NAME="Graphic23" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-line-of-mods.png" WIDTH="152"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can move individual
 controllers up and down, or you can select and move them in groups.
 It's rather less obvious than selections elsewhere, but if you look
 closely, you can see that selected controller bars are each outlined in
 red.</P>

HEIGHT="75" NAME="Graphic24" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-selected-controllers.png" WIDTH="139">

 drag these up and down as a group, they all move at once.</P>

 View</H1>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">So far, we've only looked at the
 main window, and have not really edited anything. Rosegarden provides
 three different editors, each with its own unique view of the data. You
 can view the raw Rosegarden events with the Event List Editor, you can
 work with a piano roll metaphor with the Matrix Editor, or you can see
 your data as notation with the Notation Editor. Each of these editors
 works on a segment level, so you must have at least one segment
 selected in order to open one. If you wish to start with an editor from
 scratch, you must first create an empty segment with the pencil tool,
 as I described in chapter 2, and then select it.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_1">6.1 The Event List Editor</A></H2>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">Out of the box, the Notation
 Editor is the default, but that is a chapter unto itself. For the
 moment, let us begin with the simplest of the three. Pick a segment,
 and then right click on it. Choose &quot;Open in Event List Editor&quot; from the
 resulting context menu.</P>

<H3><A NAME="6_1_1">6.1.1 Suggested Uses</A></H3>
<H4><A NAME="6_1_1_1">6.1.1.1 Inserting a Mid-Composition Program Change</A>
</H4>
<H2><A NAME="6_2">6.2 The Matrix Editor</A></H2>
<P>The Matrix editor is based around the familiar piano roll metaphor
 you have probably seen in other packages. It is useful for taking a
 hands on approach to tweaking notes where their performance is more
 important than their visual appearance as notation. I find myself using
 the Matrix most often for two main purposes. It's my preferred method
 of sequencing percussion parts, and I use it to knock notes out of
 precise alignment on purpose; for example, when sequencing rolled
 chords in order to make a MIDI guitar sound more credible.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_1">6.2.1 Special Considerations of Performance vs.
 Display</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">It is important to note that Rosegarden is
 not purely a MIDI sequencer, and at no time can you ever directly edit
 raw MIDI events. It stores events using an internal meta format that
 includes quite a bit of information about each note. Rosegarden's
 events do of course cover the fundamentals of pitch, velocity and
 duration, but they also include such attributes as stem direction, beam
 state, accidental state, ties, slurs, slashes, accents and so forth. Of
 special note, every Rosegarden event maintains independent duration
 values for performance and display. This makes it possible to create a
 composition that looks good printed on paper, and yet preserves all of
 the slight human imperfections that give a performance its character.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In version 1.0, the Matrix can only edit<B>
 performance</B> attributes. This can create interesting challenges both
 for performance and notation. If you are working on a human
 performance, and you draw notes to their full length here in the
 Matrix, you may damage the character of the performance slightly. On
 the other hand, if you draw slightly long or short notes here, or knock
 the timing off the grid lines intentionally, you will create ugly
 notation in the process. In either case, you can make adjustments to
 massage away these differences from the Notation Editor, as I will
 explain in the next chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">One particularly
 noteworthy side effect of the way Rosegarden stores events is that tied
 notes are a series of discrete dashes here on the Matrix. It is really
 not possible to determine whether a series of notes at the same pitch
 will sound as one note or several without looking at the affected area
 from the Notation Editor.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_2">6.2.2 Overview</A></H3>
<P>Let's start with an empty segment one measure long, and I'll show you
 the basics. Draw your segment, select it, and then right click on it
 and choose &quot;Open in Matrix Editor&quot; from the resulting context menu.
 You'll see something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="371" NAME="Graphic4"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-overview.png" WIDTH="477"></P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_3">6.2.3 Entering New Notes</A></H3>
<P>Now let's do a little one bar loop for demonstration purposes. Just
 like on the main view, the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="26" NAME="Graphic65"
SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" WIDTH="27"> cursor is used to
 create something new from scratch. In this case, of course, we're
 entering a note. Let's pepper this thing with a few well placed random
 pitches:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="128" NAME="Graphic5"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-new-notes.png" WIDTH="200"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You may have noticed that those came out as quarter
 notes. In order to control the default length of new notes, you must
 change the grid setting. Let's enter eight 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. First
 dial in the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the grid button:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="190" NAME="Graphic6"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-dial-grid.png" WIDTH="115"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now new notes you enter will take this duration by
 default:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="141" NAME="Graphic7"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-8th-notes.png" WIDTH="217"></P>
<P>It's obviously a bit tedious, but you can enter an entire composition
 this way if you desire.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_4">6.2.4 Adjusting Existing Notes</A></H3>
<P>You can move notes around with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="29"
NAME="Graphic8" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-cursor.png" WIDTH="27"> cursor.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="158" NAME="Graphic9"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-notes.png" WIDTH="213"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can resize notes with the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
HEIGHT="26" NAME="Graphic11" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-cursor.png" WIDTH="29">
 cursor, by clicking on a note and dragging it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="142" NAME="Graphic10"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-notes.png" WIDTH="210"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">By default, resize operations snap to grid lines. If you
 wish to drag the note to some arbitrary length, do so by holding the
 shift key while dragging the note.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="113" NAME="Graphic12"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arbitrary-resize.png" WIDTH="212"></P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_5">6.2.5 Selecting and Acting on Multiple Notes</A></H3>
<P>All of these operations can be performed on more than one note at a
 time. In order to do so, you need to make a selection. You can use the <IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="27" NAME="Graphic13" SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png"
WIDTH="27"> cursor to select individual notes one by one while holding
 down the shift key.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="158" NAME="Graphic14"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-individual-notes.png" WIDTH="200"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you wish to select a broad range of notes, you can
 select every note of a given pitch by selecting the arrow cursor and
 shift clicking on the individual notes on the piano keyboard. Each
 click will select every note of the desired pitch, and you can select
 any number of pitches in this fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="136" NAME="Graphic15"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-pitch.png" WIDTH="203"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is also possible to select a band or several bands of
 notes by sweeping the arrow cursor across the keys while holding shift.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="138" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-sweep-selection.png" WIDTH="205"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, you can use my selection event filter to cull
 events from your selection. Start by making a broad selection, and then
 click on the filter icon to summon my dialog. You can then dial in
 various criteria for the notes you wish to remain selected after the
 filter is applied. I will cover various uses for this in more depth
 later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="254" NAME="Graphic17"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter.png" WIDTH="263"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>(Yes,<B> my</B> selection event filter. I'm not just
 an author, I also pretend to know C++ on occasion. Please do let me
 know if you find it useful, or if there's anything you'd like added to
 it, or removed from it.)</I></P>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_6">6.2.6 Velocity</A></H3>
<P>Velocity is a MIDI parameter that describes how hard a note was hit
 on the keyboard or other device. It allows for finer expression of
 volume than what can be accomplished merely by adjusting the volume
 parameter for the MIDI channel. If you have a velocity sensitive
 keyboard, this parameter will be recorded as you play. Under certain
 other circumstances, you may end up with events that have no velocity
 property at all, or a default velocity of 100. Regardless of how it did
 (or didn't) get there, it's a simple matter to tweak it to suit your
 needs.</P>
<H4><A NAME="6_2_6_1">6.2.6.1 Showing the Velocity Ruler</A></H4>
<P>If the events you're editing have velocity properties, you can edit
 them with the Velocity Ruler. If it's not visible, turn it on from the
 View menu with<B> View -&gt; Show Velocity Property Ruler</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, all the events have a
 velocity of 100, and they show up as orange bars on the ruler.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="266" NAME="Graphic19"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-default-velocity-ruler.png" WIDTH="214"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">They can be changed by
 dragging them up and down, and the bars change colors to reflect their
 value. Here I've arranged them so that you can see each bar. Notice
 that the notes on the Matrix itself change to reflect these same
 colors.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="112" NAME="Graphic20"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arranged-velocity.png" WIDTH="167"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: It can indeed be
 somewhat tricky to know which note you're adjusting if there are
 several notes of the same duration at the same time. I truthfully have
 no idea if there is some trick to this to make managing the process
 more foolproof. If anyone knows, email me, and I will mention in the
 next edition.</I></P>
<H4><A NAME="6_2_6_2">6.2.6.2 What If There's No Velocity Property?</A></H4>
<P>Sometimes note events are created without velocity properties. In
 that case, there will be nothing to see or do on the Velocity Ruler
 until you add some velocities. You'll need to select a range of notes
 and then use<B> Adjust -&gt; Velocity -&gt; Set Event Velocities</B> to
 create some. This presents you with a dialog box that offers you
 several different options for how to set these up. The Value ranges
 from 0, which is the softest possible key strike, to 127, which is the
 most forceful.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="115" NAME="Graphic18"

<BR>
<BR></A></H4>
<H3><A NAME="6_2_7">6.2.7 Controllers</A></H3>
<P>It's possible to transmit controllers from here in the matrix with
 the various Control Rulers. Let's add a Modulation ruler. Choose<B>
 View -&gt; Add Event Ruler -&gt; Modulation Controller</B> and you should now
 have a new tab at the bottom of your Matrix.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="121" NAME="Graphic21"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler.png" WIDTH="296"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you right click on the
 ruler you can insert a controller event, or even an entire line of
 them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="84" NAME="Graphic22"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler-line.png" WIDTH="145"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, I have
 elected to insert a line of controllers. It's impossible to capture X
 cursors, and I'm far too lazy to try to draw that little pointing
 finger, so I will instead describe what I did. After making the
 selection from the menu, the cursor changed to a pointing finger. I
 picked a start point with this finger, and continued to hold the button
 down while dragging the resulting line up and to the right. After I
 released the button, it produced this line of controllers:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="112" NAME="Graphic23"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-line-of-mods.png" WIDTH="152"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can move individual
 controllers up and down, or you can select and move them in groups.
 It's rather less obvious than selections elsewhere, but if you look
 closely, you can see that selected controller bars are each outlined in
 red.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="75" NAME="Graphic24"
SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-selected-controllers.png" WIDTH="139"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you hold down shift and
 drag these up and down as a group, they all move at once.</P>

 Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
 window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and control
 a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.1 <A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
 primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
 these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name
 tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate segments,
 and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain these concepts
 in more detail later on.) This is also where you configure segment
 parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time signature settings
 exist a composition level, and they may be edited here in the main
 window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of the

 several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the

<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist is
 a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
 different parameters. Each track has a label and an output assignment,
 and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either MIDI or audio
 data, but never both.</P>

 compositions are made up of<B> segments</B>, and editing at the
 composition level involves dragging them around and rearranging them
 within tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold either
 MIDI events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an
 image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split,
 re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are
 very flexible. While there are, understandably, some differences in the
 way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be manipulated in almost
 exactly the same way within the composition. The only real limitation
 is that audio segments and MIDI segments cannot both play in the same
 track.</P>

 Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be a

 whichever track is currently active.</P>

 Audio segments can be split and resized, but they cannot be joined or
 merged. If you split an audio segment, you can undo that operation to
 revert it to its original state, but you cannot, for example, cut out
 the middle and splice the ends back together. Neither can you merge two
 overlapping audio segments into one, nor merge audio and MIDI segments
 together.</P>

 If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
 together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts. You
 can use<B> Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B> and then
 make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc. from the
 resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split the
 segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up with
 treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble part.</P>

<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
 dial a transposition setting into the<B> Transpose</B> box. This will

<P>There are a few main window features that don't quite fit in anywhere
 else, yet which bear special mention.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_8_1">3.8.1 Importing and Merging Other
 Compositions</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Several options are available for
 importing and merging material from other sources. On the<B> File -&gt;
 Import</B> menu, you can import standard MIDI files (<B>*.mid</B>) and
 Hydrogen<B> (*.h2song)</B> files. On the<B> File -&gt; Merge</B> menu, you
 can merge these and other data sources (including native Rosegarden
 composition (<B>*.rg</B>) files) into the existing composition.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="3_8_2">3.8.2 Autosave</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 If you have a power outage or the like, the next time you start
 Rosegarden and attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll be
 presented with the option of loading the autosave file instead. If you
 hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory
 with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
 Settings menu. If you notice Rosegarden grabbing a lot of your CPU time
 for no apparent reason, it's probably autosave, and you might want to
 increase the interval, or turn this feature completely off. It can
 become quite cumbersome when working on very large compositions. This
 feature was frankly more useful when Rosegarden was young, and
 unstable.</P>

<H1><A NAME="6">6 Recording (first draft)</A></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to record
 with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most obvious
 thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record button to
 record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If audio is your
 aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and get to work. On
 the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
 chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
 For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed from
 the main window.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_1">6.1 Recording MIDI</A></H2>
<P>You can record MIDI from any source that Rosegarden recognizes as a
 record device, as I mentioned in some detail in<A HREF="chapter-4.html#4_2_2">
 Chapter 4</A>.</P>
<P>To recap briefly, click the <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic5" SRC="../pixmaps/studio-icon.png" > icon to have a look at
 your current studio, then look at the &quot;Record devices&quot; section of the
 dialog. Any inputs you have available will appear in this list, and you
 may set any number of them as active recording sources by toggling the
 &quot;Current&quot; checkboxes for each of them. In this example, I have both the
 external MIDI port on my soundcard and Virtual Keyboard available, and
 marked as active.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic17"
SRC="../pixmaps/studio-record-devices.png" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_1_1">6.1.1 Create a MIDI Track</A></H3>
<P>You most than likely already have plenty of MIDI tracks, but it bears
 mentioning for the sake of completeness that you must route a track's
 output to a MIDI or synth plugin device in order for that track to
 become a MIDI track, and therefore capable of serving as a destination
 for MIDI recording operations. Please review<A HREF="chapter-5.html">
 Chapter 5</A> if you have any questions about instrument assignment.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2">6.2 Recording Audio</A></H2>
<P>Audio recording is considerably more involved than MIDI, but it can
 become second nature after a bit of practice getting everything in
 order beforehand.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_1">6.2.1 Set a New Audio Path!</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to record audio, the first thing you should do is create
 a new directory for the files, and set the audio record path for this
 composition to that directory via<B> Composition -&gt; Edit Document
 Properties -&gt; Audio</B>. This dialog also shows you how much space you
 have remaining on the target device, and estimates how much room you
 have to store audio files.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic7"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-new-audio-path.png" ></P>
<P>Rosegarden writes files with names like &quot;RG-AUDIO-00001.wav&quot; to this
 directory. Every botched take, every empty recording where you got the
 mixer set wrong, every goof in the world will get a new filename with a
 new number. If you don't sort your audio files into directories grouped
 by project, you'll eventually wind up with a horrible mess to sort out,
 with little choice but to audition each and every one of them to find
 out what is what. Discipline in remembering to choose a new audio path
 for each new project really pays off in the long run avoiding this
 problem. (Don't ask me how I know this.)</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_2">6.2.2 Create an Audio Track</A></H3>
<P>You may already have audio tracks, but in the event that you don't,
 merely route a track to an instrument belonging to the Audio device, as
 described in<A HREF="chapter-5.html"> Chapter 5</A></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_3">6.2.3 Configure the Mixer</A></H3>
<P>If you want to record audio, you need an audio source available, and
 you need to configure your mixer to record from this source. Getting
 everything tweaked up in order to achieve the desired results can
 actually be quite involved; especially if you happen to have a Sound
 Blaster Live! or similar card. As that is the card I have in this
 machine, and it is also the most ridiculously complicated monstrosity I
 have ever seen, I will talk about the Sound Blaster Live! here. These
 concepts should apply in a general way to other hardware, but I can't
 possibly describe the myriad available soundcards in detail.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">[pre-publication note: I hope to buy a
 mAudio Audiophile 2496 soon, and I will document that as well. I'm
 accepting donations if anyone wants to hasten my acquisition of this
 item. (Contact me for details.) I've been working on this book for
 almost two years now, in addition to working on Rosegarden itself and
 helping the user community directly on rosegarden-user. Some of you out
 there don't have a wife and two kids, a mortgage, car payments, debt
 out the wazoo, etc. and can spare a few bucks. It would definitely not
 be inappropriate for someone to pony up and help me buy one of these
 things so I can write about it. I'd really like to have an example from
 both the amateur and the pro sides of the aisle. Plus, of course, I
 want one for my own creative purposes as well.]</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_3_1">6.2.3.1 Capture vs. Playback</A></H4>
<P>Any soundcard worthy of serious consideration should be capable of
 full duplex operation. This means it can play and record
 simultaneously. In mixer terms, the recording side is configured via
 the<B> Capture</B> tab.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic8"
SRC="../pixmaps/mastering-capture-emu-ext.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">On the Sound Blaster Live!,
 there are a variety of capture options. The &quot;Capture&quot; slider controls
 the overall capture level. To record the on-board Emu synth, activate
 the &quot;Music Capture.&quot; To record other audio streams that JACK might be
 playing, activate the &quot;Wave Capture.&quot; The remaining capture options are
 all associated with the &quot;AC97 Capture&quot; slider. This can be used to
 record from a microphone (&quot;Mic&quot;) or from a line level audio source such
 as an external mixer, a guitar effects box, an external synth, or the
 like (&quot;Line.&quot;) It can also be used to capture the entire mix (&quot;Mix&quot;)
 and several other sources. Only one of these can be selected at a time.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Playback is configured via
 the<B> Playback</B> and<B> Ext. Source Playback</B> tabs. On my Sound
 Blaster Live!, the &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;PCM&quot; sliders are completely useless. I
 think perhaps it might be due to my using the coaxial digital out to
 connect to a cheap home theater. Everything on the<B> Ext. Source
 Playback</B> tab is useless except &quot;AC97,&quot; which plays whatever that
 source is capturing.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic9"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-mixer-playback.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic10"
SRC="../pixmaps/mastering-ext-src-playback.png" ></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_3_2">6.2.3.2 Mixing for Results</A></H4>
<P>There are too many possible ways to mix capture and recording to
 describe them all. Getting the results you want comes down to recording
 the guitar without unintentionally recording a permanent mix of the
 guitar with the bass part you just recorded, or with a MIDI part, or
 what have you. It's also important to avoid clipping.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_3_2_1">6.2.3.2.1 Clipping</A></H5>
<P>One major concern when recording audio is clipping. In simple terms,
 clipping occurs when you record at too high a level and permanently
 clip the tops and bottoms off of the sampled wave form. In this
 example, the green saw wave is comfortably within bounds, and no
 clipping occurs. The red one has been clipped severely. Clipped wave
 forms sound terrible. In the real world, it's rare to find something as
 flat and even as this simple drawing, so it is quite easy to wind up
 with a sample where the quiet to moderate passage are perfectly fine,
 but the louder parts are grossly distorted.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic11"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-clipping.png" ></P>
<P>Rosegarden and JACK avoid clipping by converting data into an
 internal format with much more resolution than what can be stored to
 disk. If you set a level too high on an audio track, for example, and
 cause clipping, no permanent harm comes to the data until that data is
 physically written out into a<B> .wav</B> file. However, since the
 process of recording audio involves a continuous cycle of capturing a
 snippet of data into a buffer and then flushing it out to disk once
 that buffer is full, recording operations effectively involve an
 immediate conversion of the data to a<B> .wav</B>
<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
 file, even though the
 Rosegarden interface insulates you from this fact.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">What that means for you, is that it is
 very important to check your levels before you lay down your best
 licks. If your input gain is too high, permanent clipping can occur,
 and your recording will sound horrible. I suggest that you do a number
 of test recordings during each new session to verify that everything is
 in order before sitting down to do any serious playing. Try to play
 snippets at the same range of volume and intensity you will use for the
 real recording to ensure you will avoid clipping off your louder
 passages. If the level is too high, fiddle with, well, pretty much
 everything until you have arrived at a satisfactory combination of
 mixer settings and, for example, guitar volume to get good results. A
 weak recording can be amplified, but a clipped recording is ruined
 forever.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_2_3_2_2">6.2.3.2.2 Other Unintended
 Consequences</A></H5>
<P>In addition to allowing for clipping, make sure everything else is
 going to come out right before you start laying down the best licks of
 your life, only to find you've just recorded them with the cheesy
 metronome, or permanently mixed with the MIDI tracks that were
 playing.. Microphone recordings are particularly troublesome, because
 if you can hear the parts you're jamming along with, so can the
 microphone. I find it useful to listen to the other parts with
 headphones at such times, or to switch the transport to visual
 metronome mode (as described in Chapter 2.) I can't imagine what sort
 of equipment you have at your disposal, so I fear I really have to
 leave the rest of this up to you to figure out.</P>
<P>[Research needed. JACK has &quot;monitors&quot; and I have no idea what they're
 for. I need to look into that. Anyone reading this who knows, feel free
 to send me a note.]</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_3">6.3 Check Your Configuration</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden can provide a count-in to give you an opportunity to help
 you come in on the right beat. It defaults to two measures, but you can
 change it via<B> Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; General -&gt;
 Behavior</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic1"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-count-in.png" ></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_3_1">6.3.1 The Finite Composition</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You should also be aware that Rosegarden compositions
 are of a finite length, and they do not expand to accommodate
 additional events if you attempt to record past the end of one. Once
 the transport reaches the end, everything comes to a screeching halt.
 This can be an extremely irritating buzz kill, and it has bitten me
 innumerable times. My best grooves always seem to be the ones I missed
 recording because I ran into the brick wall at the end of the ride. In
 order to cope with this unfortunate design flaw, you must anticipate
 how much room you need and expand the composition to a suitable size
 beforehand, via<B> Composition -&gt; Change Composition Duration.</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: Many of you have
 written to complain about this behavior. I hate it just as much as you
 do. We at Rosegarden don't need to hear any further complaints to
 realize that everyone hates this. Please live with it for the time
 being, and rest assured that a self-expanding composition is almost
 certain to appear in the next release.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_3_1_1">6.3.1.1 Audio Recording Time</A></H4>
<P>If you are recording audio, your total recording time will be the
 greater of the composition duration, as determined by the tempo and
 total number of measures, or the audio recording time limit you set via<B>
 Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Sequencer -&gt; Record and Mix</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic6"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-audio-limit.png" ></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_4">6.4 Play Something!</A></H2>
<P>From here, all you need to do to get the ball rolling for a normal
 recording is hit a record button</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic2" SRC="../pixmaps/recording-record-button.png"
> on any of the various transports to start the transport
 rolling.</P>
<P>A dialog will appear to inform you of how much time you have
 remaining from the point at which recording began until the end of the
 composition, or until the audio recording limit is reached. If the time
 is too short, see my notes in the previous section about adjusting the
 composition duration and audio recording limit.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic4"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-time-remaining.png" ></P>
<P>In this recording mode, playback will jump back by the number of
 count-in measures you have configured. If the playback pointer was
 rewound to the beginning of the composition, recording will begin
 before the composition actually starts. If you have moved it to the
 start of measure 6, for example, the playback pointer will jump back to
 measure 4 (by default) and recording will actually begin at that
 location. This is done so that you have no danger of losing notes if
 you come in ahead of selected start point.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_4_1">6.4.1 Previews</A></H3>
<P>As you play, a red segment will emerge, and it will expand as you go.
 If you are recording MIDI, and have segment previews turned on, you
 will see a running preview of what you are recording.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NAME="Graphic3"
SRC="../pixmaps/recording-running-preview.png" ></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are recording audio, the preview won't appear
 until after the recording has ended.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_5">6.5 Punch In</A></H2>
<P>In addition to normal recording, you can start the transport rolling
 and then punch in with the space bar.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="6_6">6.6 [Any questions? (temporary)</A></H2>
<P>This is brand new and off the cuff. Did I leave anything important
 out? Did I leave you scratching your head wondering what on earth I was
 talking about? Do you have questions/comments? The time to tell me is
 now, before final publication of this book.]</P>

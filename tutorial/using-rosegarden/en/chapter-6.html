	De-Humanizing</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Now that we're down to a reasonable register, let's do something
	about the ugly notes. The problem with human performance data is
	that it doesn't scale well into notation. You'll notice that some of
	the notes are displaying in yellow. That's because they're notes
	whose timing and duration don't quite make sense to Rosegarden
	within the context of this measure, so it has colored them to let
	you know that the notes on the page are only an approximation of
	what will actually be played. To see a view of the data in a more
	pure format, use the<B> Matrix</B> or<B> Event List</B> editors,
	which we'll take a look at later on.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Since our objective here is to make the notation more readable, we
	might as well remain here and alter the data until it better fits
	into place within the context of notation. In this instance,
	readability is more important to us than the faithful rendering of a
	human performance, so we're going to end up making &quot;physical&quot;
	changes to the data along the way.</P>
	<H3 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="6_2_1"></A>
	5.2.1 Quantize</H3>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	I think this data is so messy that we're going to have to quantize
	it. Let's<B> Undo</B> that last change, and play with<B> Transform
	-&gt; Quantize</B> instead. Let's tell it to<B> Quantize: Event
	positions, and round durations to exact notes</B>. We'll leave the<B>
	Base duration unit</B> at 16<SUP>th</SUP>, and accept the default<B>
	Note rounding</B> values and see where that gets us:</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Not too bad. It's looking much better:</P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Let's see how those changes sound, and then we'll see about turning
	those 16<SUP>th</SUP> note/rest pairs into something a little easier
	to read...</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	The quantized notes seem to have fallen into place along sane
	boundaries without having an undue impact on the rhythm or feel of
	the piece. Bearing that in mind, let's back up a step and see what
	would have happened if we had quantized on 8<SUP>th</SUP> note
	boundaries. Hit<B> ctrl-Z</B> or use<B> Edit -&gt; Undo</B>, then
	run through the<B> Transformations -&gt; Quantize</B> dialog again,
	specifying a base duration of 8<SUP>th</SUP> note this time around.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Very nice indeed, and Rosegarden has rendered some 16<SUP>th</SUP>
	notes and other odd bits as required, ignoring the base duration
	when it really had to. That's one of the best jobs of quantization
	I've seen in a notation editor. There won't be much clean-up to do
	from here:</P>

	5.2.2 Adding Marks</H3>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	We've changed the flavor somewhat by lengthening those notes. Let's
	make them staccato. There isn't currently an icon for this, but
	you'll find it on the menu. First you'll need to make a selection.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

	cursor from the<B> Toolbar</B>. Click at a point to the left of one
	of the notes to begin the selection. Drag the blue selection box so
	that it includes the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes. When they're
	selected, they'll turn blue. Now use<B> Marks -&gt; Add Staccato</B>.

	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	One measure further into the segment, there are some rhythms that
	could probably be written so that they're less awkward to count.
	Let's see about changing them.</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	There's an odd dotted 16<SUP> th</SUP> with 32<SUP>nd</SUP> rest
	combination that should probably be another stacatto 8<SUP>th</SUP>
	note:</P>

	note button 
	<IMG SRC="using-rosegarden_html_4b0b8237.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=50 BORDER=0>

	th</SUP> note's head. It changes into an 8<SUP>th</SUP> note, and

	5.2.5 Let's Add Some Slurs</H3>

	Let's add some slurs as well. Highlight the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP>

	5.2.6 Manual Beaming 
	</H3>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Now let's do two more things to enhance readability. I'm used to
	reading beamed groups that count out to one beat. Let's separate
	those two groups, and add another slur. Select the first two 8<SUP>th</SUP>
	notes in that four-note group, then use<B> Group -&gt; Beam Group</B>
	to fuse those two together. The remaining two notes adapt
	automatically, and remain beamed. Now select all four of the 8<SUP>th</SUP>
	notes plus the half note and add a slur. Finally, notice that the
	note stems are in the way of the slur. Let's select the second pair
	of 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes and use<B> Notes -&gt; Stem Direction -&gt;
	Stems Down</B> or else<B> ctrl-PageDown</B> to change their
	direction. You should wind up with a measure resembling this one:</P>

	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	Continue in this fashion until you finish altering the notation so
	that it's nice and tidy. I think you should have a pretty good idea
	how to proceed from here, so I'm not going to walk you through the
	rest of this job.</P>

	Printing</H2>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
	current design plan calls for a rudimentary print facility
	incorporated within Rosegarden itself, whose purpose is to allow
	rough draft printing, combined with off-loading the task onto an
	external utility for high quality printing. The print engine in CVS
	works pretty well for draft printing. The print engine in 0.9.0 is
	totally horrible. If you want to print notation, dump 0.9.0 and get
	CVS.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The
	&quot;external utility&quot; of choice is Lilypond, and we've put a
	lot of effort into making Rosegarden a useful front end for
	Lilypond. We also support music XML, but the active development is
	on Lilypond export.</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
	If you have a look at the<B> File -&gt; Export...</B> menu, you'll
	see that it's possible to export your compositions in both Lilypond
	and MusicXML formats:</P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">I've
	spent many hours on the Lilypond export code myself, trying to make
	it work as well as possible. I've added a lot to what Hans
	originally provided, and there have been many improvements. Notably,
	I've taken advantage of Rosegarden's new &quot;metadata&quot;
	facility to provide mechanism for exporting user-specified headers.<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"-->
	I'm very grateful to Chris and Guillaume for providing some way for
	me to be able to export these, and for you to enter them. This
	really deserves a proper explanation, complete with visuals, but I
	don't have time to do it right. For now, a brief description:</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Look at<B>
	Edit -&gt; Edit Document Properties<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--></B>
	, then look at the<B> Description<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--></B>
	tab. Put the header name (eg. &quot;title&quot;) in the<B> Name<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--></B>
	field, and the string you want attached to that header in the<B>
	Value<!--SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"--></B> field. All 14
	possible headers are exported now, but the interface is still a bit
	weird.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">In spite
	of all this effort, however, Lilypond export is an imperfect thing.
	Rosegarden and Lilypond have different ideas about how to draw some
	things, and there's no getting around the need to manually tweak
	your Lilypond files for the best possible results, or at least to
	feed the export a set of things that it can translate well.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">With
	careful planning, good results are possible, but if you attach five
	marks to every note and have all sorts of performance directions and
	whatnot in the same space, Lilypond will jumble it up. There just
	isn't any reasonable mechanism for getting Lilypond to render things
	as far above or below the staff as Rosegarden does, and there's only
	so much an export filter can do.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If
	there's something you don't like about the Lilypond export, please
	let me know. Hans is still the official &quot;owner&quot; of the
	code, but I'm currently the one actively working on it. There are
	still some bugs and missing features, and I'm eager to get user
	feedback; particularly to hear whether you like the way I've
	implemented the new features, and what you'd like done differently.
	I want to make this as useful to you as it can be, and I have both
	the time and willingness to devote a lot of effort to incremental
	improvements.</P>

<H1><A NAME="2">2 Producing Sound</A></H1>
<P>Many users have written to ask why they are unable to get Rosegarden
 to make any noise. It is the most common question asked on the
 rosegarden-user mailing list by far, and is especially troublesome for
 those newly migrating to Linux from Windows. Before we start Rosegarden
 for the first time, I want to explain what is necessary to pave the
 way, and have a good first experience. Some of you already know all
 this, and those of you who do are invited to jump ahead to the next
 chapter, where the interesting part begins.</P>
<P>The topic of sound covers two distinct areas that may or may not be
 codependent, depending on the hardware and software you have available.
 One the one hand, there are several requirements that must be met in
 order to play MIDI with Rosegarden, and on the other, it's necessary to
 get the JACK server up and running reliably in order to make use of
 Rosegarden's audio features. A working JACK server is also required to
 play MIDI with synth plugins, or to play more than one ALSA software
 synth at a time. Getting Rosegarden to make noise can be a complicated
 business, but hopefully I can help you deal with whatever set of
 circumstances you have before you. I cannot, however, cover every
 detail of getting every card working with every distribution. I'm
 afraid I have to leave some questions unanswered, lest this chapter
 become a book unto itself.</P>
<P>Here is a roadmap showing all the possible ways to produce sound with
 Rosegarden at a glance. It's quite daunting, I know, but I hope I can
 help you make sense of it:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="518" NAME="Graphic16"
SRC="../pixmaps/sound-diagram-master.jpg" WIDTH="532"></P>
<H2><A NAME="2_1">2.1 Playing MIDI</A></H2>
<P>MIDI under Linux is quite a complicated subject. The available
 hardware falls into three broad categories, each with its own special
 considerations.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"> External MIDI hardware</FONT>,<FONT
COLOR="#5c8526"> internal hardware with ALSA support</FONT>, and
 internal hardware without ALSA support. The latter category splits into<FONT
COLOR="#9966cc"> ALSA soft synths</FONT> and<FONT COLOR="#5e11a6"> synth
 plugins</FONT>, which are similar, but slightly different.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_1_1">2.1.1 External MIDI Interfaces</A></H3>
<P>By far the least complicated, and most expensive way to play MIDI
 under Linux is to use real MIDI equipment. This can include keyboards,
 sound modules, and perhaps even MIDI guitars. A wide range of equipment
 is available for this purpose, ranging from comparatively inexpensive
 consumer keyboards to professional quality gear. The cost ranges from
 hundreds to thousands of dollars however, and this is not the way to go
 unless you are serious about MIDI.</P>
<P>If you're fortunate enough to have such equipment, then you probably
 already have some idea how to hook it up to your computer. If the
 equipment has the ability to produce sound on its own, as some MIDI
 keyboards do, then you may wish to use those speakers for MIDI
 playback. If your MIDI equipment has no speakers, or if you intend to
 record the audio output from this equipment, you may wish to connect
 the audio output from your keyboard or sound module to an audio input
 jack on your soundcard. This will allow you to route everything through
 the<FONT COLOR="#ff8080"> soundcard's mixer</FONT>. There are several
 choices for external MIDI interfaces.</P>
<H4><A NAME="2_1_1_1">2.1.1.1 Joystick Port MIDI Adapters</A></H4>
<P>The simplest, least expensive route is the joystick port MIDI
 adapter. These are found on many common, low-end soundcards, such as
 the Sound Blaster PCI 128 (snd-ens1371). It can be somewhat difficult
 to obtain a suitable Y-cable or MIDI box to connect to these things,
 but after having obtained one, all that remains is to connect your
 equipment using standard 5-pin DIN MIDI cables. With the snd-ens1371
 driver, and those for many similar cards, it's only a matter of making
 sure the<B> snd-seq-midi</B> and<B> snd-rawmidi</B> drivers are loaded
 (using whatever mechanism your particular distribution provides for
 that function.)</P>
<H4><A NAME="2_1_1_2">2.1.1.2 USB MIDI Interfaces</A></H4>
<P>USB is supplanting traditional MIDI cabling, and several
 manufacturers are producing keyboards that plug directly into your
 computer using standard USB cables. There are also devices available
 which provide multi-port MIDI hubs. These hubs attach to your computer
 using a USB cable, and the hubs provide several traditional 5-pin MIDI
 sockets.</P>
<H5>2.1.1.2.1 USB Keyboards</H5>
<P><A HREF="http://www.evolution.co.uk/">Evolution</A> manufactures
 several models that are known to conform to the standard USB MIDI
 specification, which are therefore compatible with Linux. Chris Cannam,
 one of the core Rosegarden developers, uses an Evolution-2 keyboard,
 and reports that it works using the <FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">
snd-usb-audio</FONT> module, which should probably be loaded
 automatically by hotplug. He imagines that most other manufacturers'
 wares are similar.</P>
<H5>2.1.1.2.2 USB MIDI Hubs</H5>
<P>The Edriol UM-2 and mAudio MidiSport 2x2 are known to work under
 Linux. I have no experience with such things myself, I'm afraid, so I
 can only provide second-hand information.</P>
<P>Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas, a contributing Rosegarden developer, reports
 that getting the Edriol UM-2 working is as simple as plugging in the
 USB cable and loading the <FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-usb-audio</FONT>
 module, which should probably be loaded automatically by hotplug.</P>
<P>Pedro and Chris both report that the mAudio MidiSport hubs are more
 difficult to get working. Pedro reports that &quot;some of them require a
 firmware program to be loaded into the device's RAM before you can use
 it. There are GPL firmwares (package ezusbmidi) for the 1-port and
 2-port devices (up to Midisport2x2), they are provided as RPM packages
 for Red Hat by<A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">
 CCRMA,</A> and for Mandrake by<A HREF="http://rpm.nyvalls.se/"> Thac</A>
. There are also ready to use packages from AGNULA/Debian and Gentoo. Or
 you can tweak and compile the firmware from its sources.&quot; Chris reports
 that users with 2.6-series kernels may have difficulty using these
 devices. Pedro suggests that you have a look at the<A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/usbmidi.html">
 zero config environment</A> information available from CCRMA if you are
 running Red Hat or Fedora.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_1_2">2.1.2 MIDI without External Hardware</A></H3>
<P>For those without external hardware to use, there are two remaining
 categories. A few soundcards have built-in MIDI infrastructure that
 ALSA can use. Everyone else will have to use some kind of software
 synth.</P>
<H4><A NAME="2_1_2_1">2.1.2.1 Cards with Synth Support under ALSA</A></H4>
<P>This is the next easiest way to get MIDI working. So far as I know,
 this category only applies to those with soundcards based on an Emu
 chipset, such as the Sound Blaster Live!/Audigy series (snd-emu10k1),
 and the AWE 32/64 (snd-emu8000). I have a Sound Blaster Live! Value
 Edition myself, and can report that it's easy to get working, and it
 sounds reasonably decent.</P>
<H5>2.1.2.1.1 SB Live! Modules</H5>
<P>First, you'll need to ensure you have the proper kernel modules
 loaded, and that you are using the ALSA modules, which have &quot;snd&quot; in
 the name. I have the following modules loaded for my own SB Live!:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-seq-oss
 snd-seq-midi snd-emu10k1-synth snd-emux-synth</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-emu10k1
 snd-pcm-oss snd-mixer-oss snd-pcm snd-timer</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-hwdep

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-rawmidi
 snd-seq-device snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<H5>2.1.2.1.2 Set the Mixer Volume</H5>
<P>Next, you'll need to check to make sure you've turned up your mixer
 volumes. I will cover this card's rather complicated mixer in detail
 when I talk about managing various inputs and outputs for the purpose
 of audio recording. For the moment, it should be sufficient to ensure
 the &quot;Music&quot; channel volume is turned up. My mixer of preference is<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~mana/kalsatools.html">
 KAmix</A>. Unfortunately, it is not widely available outside of SuSE,
 and you may have to compile it yourself. It isn't the prettiest mixer,
 but it's the only one I've found that lets me control my SB Live!
 consistently and efficiently to get the results I want.</P>
<H5>2.1.2.1.3 Load a SoundFont</H5>
<P>Finally, you'll need to load a soundfont into the card. These cards
 use .sf2 soundfonts that are readily available. I'm not aware of a
 soundfont free enough to be included with any distribution of Linux, so
 you will most likely have to obtain one from the web, or perhaps from
 the CDs that came with your soundcard. I have had good luck with
 soundfonts from the<A HREF="http://www.personalcopy.com/linuxfiles.htm">
 Personal Copy</A> website, but I make no warranty expressed or implied
 about the suitability or legality of their soundfonts, or any other
 soundfonts you might obtain on the web for any particular purpose.</P>
<P>Once you have obtained a soundfont, you need to load it into the
 card. There isn't currently any user-friendly way of managing this. I'm
 developing a utility for this very purpose, but I did not have time to
 finish it before releasing this book, and so I will make no reference
 to it. In the meantime, your two choices are to run the command line
 utility<B> <FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">asfxload</FONT></B>, or to
 configure Rosegarden to load a soundfont for you at startup, via<B>
 Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt; Sequencer -&gt; General</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="280" NAME="Graphic17"
SRC="../pixmaps/configure-soundfont.png" WIDTH="532"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<BR></P>
<H4><A NAME="2_1_2_2">2.1.2.2 Cards without Synth Support under ALSA</A></H4>
<P>This is really the &quot;everything else&quot; category. It includes too many
 soundcards to list, each with its own set of modules. The Sound Blaster
 PCI and Ensoniq AudioPCI cards (ens-1370, ens-1371, ens-1373), and
 integrated snd-intel8x0 and snd-via82xx are probably the most common,
 but soundcards that fall into this category are legion. The process for
 getting them to play MIDI is similar in all cases.</P>
<H5>2.1.2.2.1 Check your Modules</H5>
<P>First, you need to ensure you have the necessary ALSA MIDI
 infrastructure by loading the following modules in addition to whatever
 other modules you require for your particular hardware:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">
snd-seq-midi snd-seq-virmidi snd-seq-midi-event snd-seq</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">snd-timer
 snd-rawmidi snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<P><I>(The above list was extrapolated from the previous SB Live!
 example, and may contain modules that won't actually load with your
 particular hardware. If loading one or more of the above modules fails,
 don't worry about it unless you later find your MIDI subsystem doesn't
 work.)</I></P>
<H5>2.1.2.2.2 QSynth</H5>
<P>The least complicated way to get one of these cards to play MIDI is
 to use<A HREF="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/"> QSynth</A>. It is a
 simple to use ALSA soft synth that takes MIDI data as input and uses<B>
 .sf2</B> format soundfonts to produce audio output. In its simplest
 configuration, it can use ALSA for audio output, avoiding the need to
 run JACK. If you already need or want to run JACK, it can connect its
 output to JACK instead. In this configuration, you can also use a
 variety of other ALSA soft synths such as<A HREF="http://hydrogen.sourceforge.net/">
 Hydrogen</A> and<A HREF="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">
 ZynAddSubFX</A>, all sharing the same audio output. QSynth is the most
 useful for general music production, and so it is my focus here.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="117" NAME="Graphic19"
SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-main.png" WIDTH="532"></P>
<H6>2.1.2.2.2.1 Configure the Audio Driver</H6>
<P>The first decision you need to make is whether to use ALSA or JACK
 for output. I will cover starting and configuring JACK in detail in a
 moment. No matter which option you choose, both are configured via the<B>
 Setup</B> button. In this example, I'm using JACK. Take special note
 that I have adjusted the sample rate to match the sample rate I'm using
 with JACK, which is 48,000 Hz (for reasons I will explain directly.)
 Also note that I have checked<B> [x] Auto Connect JACK Outputs</B>.
 This allows QSynth to make its own default connection with JACK, which
 is very convenient.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="269" NAME="Graphic18"
SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-audio-setup.png" WIDTH="418"></P>
<H6>2.1.2.2.2.2 Loading a SoundFont</H6>
<P>Finally, it's necessary to load at least one soundfont. These are the
 same<B> .sf2</B> soundfonts used by the SB Live! series of cards, and
 they are loaded via a different tab on the same setup page.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="270" NAME="Graphic20"
SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-soundfonts.png" WIDTH="418"></P>
<H5>2.1.2.2.3 SynthPlugins</H5>
<P>It is also possible to play using synth plugins. There is a
 FluidSynth-DSSI plugin that provides essentially the same functionality
 as QSynth, except that it's integrated directly into Rosegarden. I will
 describe it in detail when I talk about assigning instruments to
 tracks, because its configuration and use is entirely internal to
 Rosegarden. For the moment it is sufficient to know that it exists, and
 that it requires a working JACK server in order to function.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_2">2.2 Playing Audio</A></H2>
<P>In order to play audio you will need to run JACK.</P>
<P>JACK is short for the Jack Audio Connection Kit. JACK is a flexible
 audio server that allows its client applications to share the audio
 hardware seamlessly, and to share a common transport. It provides
 flexible mechanisms for routing inputs and outputs to and from client
 applications using a jack-and-cable metaphor. It is geared toward the
 audio professional who wants to get the lowest possible latency and the
 best possible performance out of his or her hardware, but professional
 or not, it's something you need to come to terms with JACK if you want
 to play audio with Rosegarden.</P>
<P>Some of you may have heard of patching kernels, running with
 &quot;capabilities,&quot; and other arcane magic associated with Linux audio. All
 of that really<B> is</B> necessary to get the best performance out of
 JACK, I'm afraid. It's a very complicated business that I don't
 understand very well myself. I fear I must leave you in the hands of<A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">
 AGNULA</A> and perhaps the<A HREF="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/subscribeall.php3">
 Linux Audio Users</A> list for more information if you require more
 performance than you can by following these simple instructions to get
 JACK running as an ordinary user on an ordinary kernel.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_2_1">2.2.1 Starting and Tweaking JACK</A></H3>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use<A HREF="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/">
 <FONT FACE="courier 10 pitch">qjackctl</FONT></A>. It is a very useful
 utility that provides a convenient way to start and stop your JACK
 server, to play with various configuration parameters to find the best
 combination for your hardware, and to manage JACK connections between
 applications.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="90" NAME="Graphic21"
SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-overview.png" WIDTH="456"></P>
<H3><A NAME="2_2_2">2.2.2 Configuring the JACK Server</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
 server is configured, use the<B> Setup</B> button. The process that
 follows will probably be tedious and time-consuming, but once you have
 discovered the &quot;magic numbers&quot; for your hardware, everything should
 continue to work thereafter. Discovering the best combination is a
 process of playing with the &quot;Frames/Period&quot;, &quot;Sample Rate&quot; and
 &quot;Periods/Buffer&quot; settings. Your objective here is to find the lowest
 possible latency, as reported in the lower right-hand corner of the
 dialog. As you change settings, this number will show the results
 yielded by that combination. You want the sample rate high, and the
 frames/periods and periods/buffer low. I suggest you dial up the lowest
 possible latency, click on<B> OK</B>, then try to start the JACK server
 with the<B> Start</B> button on the main dialog. If the server fails to
 start, come back to this dialog and keep working up until you find a
 combination that works.</P>

<H4><A NAME="2_2_2_1">2.2.2.1 The Evil XRUN</A></H4>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">It's very important to avoid
 xruns. If you find a combination of low-latency settings that allow the
 JACK server to start, but which produce a flood of xruns, you're aiming
 too high. Xruns are reported in the main QJackCtl dialog. Ideally, you
 should see this:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="69" NAME="Graphic22"
SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-no-xruns.png" WIDTH="112"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If, on the other hand, you
 see something like this, you have trouble ahead:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="64" NAME="Graphic23"
SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-know-xruns.png" WIDTH="113"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium">You never want to see this
 much red. Seeing any red at all is really unacceptable. Xruns cause
 audio dropouts. Clicks, pops, distortions, flanger-like effects. They
 are to be avoided at all costs. If you cannot produce a set of
 parameters that gets JACK running without xruns, you probably have no
 choice but to explore the world of Linux audio performance tweaking.
 Even eliminating the xruns is no guarantee that you will be able to
 obtain acceptable performance running these things as an ordinary user.
 My own performance is just barely good enough that I can't quite force
 myself to dive into the arcane world of Linux audio headlong.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_2_3">2.2.3 Managing JACK Connections</A></H3>
<P>Rosegarden will establish sane default connections automatically. So
 will QSynth and Hydrogen, if you've configured them to do so.
 ZynAddSubFX and perhaps other JACK-aware applications do not do this.
 To see and change the connections, click on the<B> Connections</B>
 button. Making or breaking connections is a process of highlighting one
 or more items in the left pane and one or more items in the right pane,
 then using the<B> Connect</B> or<B> Disconnect</B> buttons as required.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="306" NAME="Graphic26"

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: You can also use
 QJackCtl to manage ALSA MIDI connections. I do not recommend that you
 do so while you are running Rosegarden. Rosegarden has its own internal
 MIDI router, and it doesn't work properly if you change MIDI
 connections externally. However, if, for example, you want to play your
 Sound Blaster Live! or QSynth with your MIDI keyboard without running
 Rosegarden, you can use QJackCtl's MIDI connection manager to hook it
 up.</I></P>

 these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name
 tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate segments,

 in more detail later on.) This is also where you configure segment
 parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time signature settings
 exist a composition level, and they may be edited here in the main

 compositions are made up of<B> segments</B>, and editing at the
 composition level involves dragging them around and rearranging them
 within tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold either
 MIDI events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an
 image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split,
 re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will, and are
 very flexible. While there are, understandably, some differences in the
 way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be manipulated in almost
 exactly the same way within the composition. The only real limitation
 is that audio segments and MIDI segments cannot both play in the same
 track.</P>

 Audio segments can be split and resized, but they cannot be joined or

 can use<B> Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B> and then

 treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble part.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3_4_8">3.4.8 Transposing Instruments</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
 dial a transposition setting into the<B> Transpose</B> box. This will

 in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_4_9">3.4.9 Delay</A></H3>
<P>The<B> Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a segment

 simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>

 I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that

 is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and can't be stressed
 enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 If you have a power outage or the like, the next time you start
 Rosegarden and attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll be
 presented with the option of loading the autosave file instead. If you
 hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave directory
 with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
 Settings menu. If you notice Rosegarden grabbing a lot of your CPU time
 for no apparent reason, it's probably autosave, and you might want to
 increase the interval, or turn this feature completely off. It was
 frankly more useful when Rosegarden was young, and unstable.</P>

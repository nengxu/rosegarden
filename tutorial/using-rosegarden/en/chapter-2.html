<H2>2.1 <A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
 window. This is where you get an overall view of your composition, and
 control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
 primarily about editing at the composition level, so most of these
 tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you name and
 assign instruments to tracks, create and manipulate segments, and watch
 a broad overview of playback. This is also where you configure segment
 parameters such as label and color. While it might be more intuitive
 for you as a composer to change tempo and time signature settings from
 within a notation view, these settings actually exist at a composition
 level, and they may be edited here in the main window using the tempo
 ruler.</P>

Special Toolbars</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of the
 first things you might notice about Rosegarden is that there are
 several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the
 usual standard controls shared by most KDE applications,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">

 there are several toolbars specific to Rosegarden. You'll choose
 various tools for selecting and manipulating segments from the Tools
 Toolbar (Select, Move, Resize, New, Erase, Split),</P>

 and once a segment has been created, you can use the Editors Toolbar to
 open it in one of the three available editors. You'll also find buttons
 to start the audio and MIDI mixers, and the Quantizer here.</P>

<I> TIP: If your Zoom Slider is cut off by a toolbar, try dragging it
 within your toolbar palette until it's the last item on the right. This
 is a known issue, but seems to be a greater QT/KDE problem, and there's
 not much the Rosegarden developers can do to avoid it. Luckily, it's
 very easy to remedy, and your toolbar settings will be remembered the
 next time you start Rosegarden.</I></P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">2.3 <A NAME="2_3"></A>Segments
 and Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
 compositions are made up of segments, and editing at the composition
 level involves dragging them around and rearranging them. Segments are
 a universal container that may hold either MIDI events or audio data.
 Segments are rather similar to layers in an image editing program such
 as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted, split, re-combined, overlapped
 and pretty much rearranged at will, and are very flexible. While there
 are understandably some differences in the way these two types of
 segments behave, they can be manipulated in almost exactly the same way
 within the composition. The only real limitation is that audio segments
 and MIDI segments cannot both play in the same track.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Unless you
 began with an imported MIDI file, your segment canvas will be empty,
 and many of the features I wish to demonstrate will be disabled.</P>

 Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be a

 in an image editing program.</P>

<I> NOTE: As of this writing, when 1.0 is still spoken of in the future
 tense, it is not possible to join audio segments in this fashion. This
 feature is planned, but may or may not make it in time for 1.0.</I></P>

 This can also merge events from several different tracks into a single
 segment. The events will combine, and merge onto a segment on whichever
 track is currently active. Obviously, you may not merge MIDI and audio
 into the same segment.</P>

 You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like just by
 looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual aid when
 dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on
 with<B> Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. This displays a miniature
 piano roll for MIDI segments, and a drawing of the wave form for audio

 Every segment can have a unique label and color. In this example, I've
 chosen the most obvious color to use for this French horn part, but
 colors are entirely user-configurable, and these defaults are only
 suggestions. I'll explain how to configure custom colors later on, in
 the Studio chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_5">2.3.5 Repeats</A></H3>
<P>Every segment can be made to repeat. It will keep repeating until the
 end of the document, or until another segment is encountered in the

 ( |: :| ) in the notation editor.</P>
<P>You can turn all repeats into copies at once with<B> Segments -&gt; Turn

<H3><A NAME="2_3_6">2.3.6 Segment Quantizer</A></H3>
<P>Changing the setting in this box will immediately quantize all notes
 in this segment to the selected grid position. It will move the start
 times forward or back to align them with the next closest beat at the
 desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any way.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_7">2.3.7 Transposing Instruments</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
 dial a transposition setting into the<B> Transpose</B>

 cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical Bb
 trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this subject
 in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_8">2.3.8 Delay</A></H3>
<P>The<B> Delay</B>

 note are the panic, metronome, and solo buttons. If they're missing,
 toggle the extra controls.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 The panic button transmits a &quot;notes off&quot; message on every channel. It
 does not transmit an &quot;all notes off&quot; or a &quot;system reset&quot; or what have
 you, but litereally transmits a notes off on every channel on every
 device Rosegarden knows about. It can take quite a long time for all
 the events to transmit, which you can see happening by watching the
 &quot;OUT&quot; area in the Transport, but it's guaranteed to shut up that
 droning C# and then some.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
 metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is a
 useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your composition.
 Configure it via<B> Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage Metronome</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
 The solo button forces the Transport to play only whatever track is
 currently selected at the moment, independent of its mute state. (To
 &quot;solo&quot; more than one part, you'll need to set the mute for tracks
 individually, or by using<B> Tracks -&gt; Mute All Tracks</B> and then
 un-muting the parts you desire.)</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_6">2.6 Time and Tempo</A></H2>

 Chapter 7</A>, but here and now you can manipulate both time signature
 and tempo to your heart's content from the main window.</P>
<P>The tempo ruler changes color to indicate changes in tempo. When a
 change occurs, the tempo is displayed along the top half of the ruler,

 I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that

 is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and can't be stressed
 enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your work.</P>

 However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a power outage or the
 like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the file
 you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of loading the
 autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it
 in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
 The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the

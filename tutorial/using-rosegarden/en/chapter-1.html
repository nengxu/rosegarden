 Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
 versatile application that seeks to be a useful tool for those wanting
 to create music. It combines aspects of a MIDI sequencer, an audio
 sequencer, and a notation editor into one convenient, easy to use
 package that provides users with a consistent and intuitive interface.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any system that
 has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently requires a
 minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run. Many of its features may only
 work Linux systems, but it is designed to compile and run on any
 Unix-like platform capable of running KDE. (See the<A HREF="http://rosegardenmusic.com/faq.html">
 FAQ</A> for details on building for systems that can't run ALSA.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 My goal in writing this guide is to help you explore Rosegarden, and to
 discover ways to use its features to solve real problems that you might
 encounter when creating your own music. Rosegarden is easy to use, once
 you come to understand its framework, but it's not quite like anything
 you are likely to have used in the past. As such, I wish to take you on
 a guided tour through Rosegarden, to demonstrate many of its
 capabilities, and to offer you a foundation from which your own
 creative projects can spring.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">1.3 <A NAME="1_3"></A>Version
 Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 This document describes Rosegarden4, the latest in this venerable line
 of applications. As of this writing, we're at version 0.9.9_cvs. The
 latest official release is 0.9.8. There are myriad older versions
 floating around, and some features described here may not work unless
 you're running something very recent.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">1.4 <A NAME="1_4"></A>The
 Author's Studio</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Obviously,
 what I can actually demonstrate is hardware dependent. I'd like you to
 bear in mind what is sitting in front of me as I write this, and thus I
 will share the details of my &quot;studio.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">I'm running
 a 2.0 GHz P4 with 512 MB of RAM; Debian Sarge, and KDE 3.2.3. I've
 compiled Debian's kerenel 2.4.26 source with Debian's pre-empt and low
 latency patches.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">My MIDI
 landscape centers around an SB Live! with an old joystick MIDI port box
 from Gravis. I have the MIDI out from a Fatar MIDI-72 controller
 keyboard attached to the MIDI in on the box, and the MIDI out on the
 box connects to the MIDI in on my Roland SC-33 Sound Canvas. I usually
 load<A HREF="ftp://anonymous@tp://ftp.personalcopy.net/pub/PC51f.sf2.gz">
 PC51f.sf2</A> into the SB Live!, and rarely change it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">In the way
 of other gear, I have a reasonably good electret microphone from Radio
 Shack, which I use to record my acoustic guitar, flute, and other
 traditional instruments. I have an electric guitar and a DigiTech
 RP-200 effects box for those times I want to play rock star.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">I route all
 of this through my Sound Blaster's mixer. I can't currently have
 everything feeding into the soundcard at the same time, and I must swap
 cables around in order to feed either the Sound Canvas or the RP-200
 into the &quot;line in&quot; jack.</P>

 need to have cute little symbols in circles or superscript or something
 attached to their names. I have far better things to do than try to
 figure out which cute little symbols are supposed to go on which names,
 but if representatives from any of the corporations who own those words
 would be so kind as to inform me which little symbols need to be
 attached to them, I will attach such symbols forthwith.</P>

<H1><A NAME="4">4 Managing &quot;Instrument Parameters&quot;</A></H1>
<P>Now that you understand have configured your default studio to suit
 your own needs, you might be wondering just how to make use of all
 those programs and controllers you set up. As I have mentioned in
 various other places, program changes and controllers in MIDI work on a
 channel level. In Rosegarden, these channel-level assignments are
 encapsulated within &quot;instruments&quot; contained within each &quot;device&quot; that
 can be assigned to any number of different tracks.</P>
<H2><A NAME="4_1">4.1 &quot;Instruments&quot;</A></H2>
<P>Rosegarden has yet another layer of abstraction between you and your
 MIDI equipment, called the &quot;instrument.&quot; Every &quot;device&quot; has 16
 &quot;instruments&quot; numbered #1 through #16. When working with MIDI playback
 devices, each of these &quot;instruments&quot; encapsulates a MIDI output channel
 (the same channel as the number of the &quot;instrument&quot; by default,
 although this relationship is not fixed), a bank/program/variation
 assignment, and any initial controllers you wish to affect the
 associated channel. These &quot;instruments&quot; allow you to assemble up to 16
 collections of programs/controllers per device and assign these
 combinations to any number of tracks.</P>
<P>When working with audio and synth plugins, these &quot;instruments&quot; serve
 the same purpose as MIDI channels, allowing you to configure up to 16
 different combinations of LADSPA plugins, volume and pan settings, and
 so forth, and then apply these combinations to any number of different
 tracks.</P>
<H2><A NAME="4_2">4.2 Routing a Track to a &quot;Device&quot; and &quot;Instrument&quot;</A></H2>
<P>The first step in the assignment process is to route a track to a
 particular &quot;device.&quot; The &quot;device&quot; you use will determine whether you
 can play audio or MIDI data on this track. In order to make this device
 assignment, begin by clicking the mouse cursor in this area, and
 holding a moment until a context menu appears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="51" NAME="Graphic3" SRC="../pixmaps/click-and-hold.png"
WIDTH="231"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 You should be presented with a series of two menus that allow you to
 choose first the &quot;device&quot; and then the &quot;instrument&quot; for this track.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 In this case, I chose to route it to my &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; device, which is
 ultimately connected through my Rosegarden studio to play through ALSA
 port 64:0, and thus the Roland Sound Canvas I have plugged into the box
 physically attached to my computer.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Then I assigned it to that device's &quot;instrument&quot; #6. Prior to taking
 this snapshot, I had already configured this &quot;instrument&quot; to play using
 the &quot;Piano 1&quot; program with the &quot;Instrument Parameters&quot; box (more on
 that in a bit), and so that name appeared in parenthesis in the second
 menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 Notice also that &quot;instrument&quot; #10 has (D) in parenthesis, indicating
 that this &quot;instrument&quot; is normally used for playing drums. (Whether it
 actually plays drums depends on the capabilities of the MIDI equipment
 or software synth represented by this &quot;device,&quot; and probably depends on
 this &quot;instrument&quot; continuing to remain at the default channel
 assignment of 10.) In this example, I arranged beforehand for this
 &quot;instrument&quot; to play using the &quot;Power&quot; drum kit.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 The remaining &quot;instruments&quot; are not assigned to anything in particular
 yet, and on most General MIDI -compliant equipment (or software synths)
 these &quot;instruments&quot; will probably play using a factory default piano
 program, with volume and other controllers set to neutral default
 values.</P>

<H2><A NAME="4_3">4.3 MIDI Instrument Parameters</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that the
 track has been throuth a MIDI output &quot;device&quot; and &quot;instrument,&quot; and is
 therefore a MIDI track, the<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box will
 display controls similar to these.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">They allow
 you to reassign the channel for this &quot;instrument,&quot; and to dial in a
 program. In this case, you can see Roland's variation system in action.
 The program is set to &quot;20. Churg Org. 1&quot; and the variation to &quot;17.
 Church Org. 3&quot; so this &quot;instrument,&quot; and any tracks routed through it,
 will play using a pipe organ sound that isn't part of the basic set of
 General MIDI programs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you want
 to select a GS-style drum kit, your<B> Instrument Parameters</B> box

<H2><A NAME="4_4">4.4 Synth Plugin Tracks</A></H2>
<P>[Waiting for this bleeding edge new feature to settle into something
 stable before I mention it in any detail... See rosegarden-devel for
 more detalis. Basically, these use plugins to play MIDI using JACK for
 audio output. They're hybrids, allowing you to create sound with a
 synth plugin and then layer LADSPA plugins on top to alter the sound.
 They take MIDI segments, but their instrument parameters are more like
 those of audio tracks, and they can't be assigned to use programs in
 the same fashion as conventional MIDI tracks; rather each synth plugin
 has its own mechanism to allow it to be dialed to use whatever it's
 capable of doing. More or less. More to follow.]</P>
<H2><A NAME="4_5">4.5 JACK Tracks</A></H2>
<P>If you want to use a track for audio, you'll need to make it a JACK
 track by routing it to the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device. (If you do not have a
 &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device available, please ensure that your JACK server is
 running. If you have problems with this, see &quot;Starting and Routing
 Audio Through JACK&quot; later on in this guide.)</P>

 in on what you want using the<B> Category:</B> selector, and then dial
 in a particular plugin with the<B> Plugin:</B> selector. As you dial
 through these, the knobs in the bottom half of this dialog box will
 change to reflect the controls that are available for this particular
 plugin; ranging from one knob to a screen full of them. You can layer
 up to five plugins for each &quot;instrument&quot; in the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device,
 hardware allowing. Some plugins are particularly expensive in their use
 of your system's resources, so using too many may cause performance
 problems.</P>

<H1><A NAME="5">5 Recording Basics</A></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to record
 with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most obvious
 thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record button to
 record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If audio is your
 aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and get to work. On
 the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
 chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
 For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed from
 the main window.</P>

<P> If you route the track to a MIDI device, (including the &quot;Synth
 plugin&quot; device, if available), then the track will become a MIDI track,
 and it can only be used to play MIDI segments. If you drag an audio
 segment onto this track by mistake, the audio will not play.
 Conversely, if you route a track to the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device, it will
 become an audio track, and it will not play any MIDI segments you
 happen to drag here by mistake.</P>

<H1><A NAME="11">11 Appendix A: MIDI Primer</A></H1>
<P>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is a simple
 serial protocol that electronic instruments and computers can use to
 talk to each other. MIDI-capable instruments vary enormously in their
 capabilities and complexity, ranging from simple analog synthesizers to
 pipe organs to electronic guitars, and even to electronic woodwinds and
 brass instruments.</P>
<P>MIDI-capable instruments aren't required to have much in common, but
 there are a several categories of characteristics that most of them
 share.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_1">11.1 Channels</A></H2>
<P>If you have a cable TV, you can receive more than one television
 channel over the same wire. MIDI channels behave in a similar fashion.
 Any one MIDI cable can be used to carry up to 16 channels of
 information. Most common modern equipment is capable of receiving on
 all 16 of these channels simultaneously, and many types of equipment
 can also transmit on more than one channel.</P>
<P>These channels work something like the tracks in Rosegarden, which is
 why channel assignment is done at the track level. If you set the
 reverb level for channel 3, this setting will only affect notes that
 are transmitted on channel 3. Channels are similarly useful for playing
 different instruments at the same time, over the same cable, or for
 playing using different voices on a single instrument.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_2">11.2 Programs</A></H2>
<P>Most common MIDI instruments are polyphonic and multi-timbral. This
 means that they can play more than one note at the same time, and they
 can play notes using different voices. Many instruments try to simulate
 a proverbial band-in-a-box by offering a range of sounds ranging from
 piano through the orchestra into synthesized and ethnic sounds. These
 simulated instruments are called either &quot;programs&quot; or &quot;patches.&quot;</P>
<P>In the most common MIDI standard, General MIDI (GM), instruments must
 be able to play using any of 127 different programs. Music written to
 be performed on one GM instrument should sound similar on any other.
 The GM specification dictates that channel 10 will play drum sounds,
 and it defines a standard arrangement of keys on the keyboard to
 represent different drums.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_3">11.3 Banks</A></H2>
<P>Beyond the GM standard, many instruments have banks of additional
 programs. Each bank can contain an additional 127 programs. The MIDI
 specification allows for a monumental number of different banks, but
 most instruments arrange banks in two common ways. The two most common
 standards for this expansion of GM are called GS (Roland) and XG
 (Yamaha.) The usual General MIDI programs are in the first bank, and
 the extra programs are found in additional banks. Each bank has a
 unique identifying number using a combination of two parameters. They
 are Least Significant Byte (LSB) and Most Significant Byte (MSB). The
 standard GM bank on every GM-compliant synth has an LSB/MSB address of
 0 0.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_4">11.4 Controllers</A></H2>
<P>MIDI allows for 127 controllers. These controllers typically work at
 a channel level, and are used to control things such as pan (how far to
 the left or right the sound will play), volume (the overall maximum
 volume for the channel), pitch bend (used to simulate guitar and
 harmonica bends, play quarter tones, as well as numerous other uses),
 reverb (makes notes on the channel sound like they're in a concert
 hall) and sustain (causes the note to keep playing unhampered until the
 sound finally dies away, like the sustain pedal on a piano). There is
 enormous variability in this area, and you will find some equipment
 that ignores them all, while other instruments will use nearly all 127
 of them. You will need to know what kind of controllers your equipment
 (or software synth) supports if you are to configure Rosegarden to make
 use of them, though it does come out of the box aware of a very limited
 subset of the most common controllers.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_5">11.5 Hardware vs. Software; soundfonts</A></H2>
<P>So far I have dealt primarily with &quot;real&quot; MIDI equipment. Where do
 soundcards and soft synths fit in?</P>
<P>Some soundcards such as the Sound Blaster Live! and its relatives
 have a hardware synth built into the card. It's synth is actually four
 synths in one, accessed through four different ports, and each of them
 can receive 16 channels of information, and can play drums on channel
 10 (making it possible to use four different drum kits simultaneously).
 Many, probably even most other common soundcards and integrated audio
 solutions do not have such hardware MIDI playback capability. Users who
 have these cards will need to run a software synth such as QSynth that
 uses the computer's resources to do what a card like the SB Live! can
 do in hardware. (I explain the vagaries of getting QSynth up and
 running and cooperating with JACK in the chapter titled &quot;You Don't Know
 JACK.&quot;)</P>
<P>The on-board synth on the SB Live! and QSynth both use the same kind
 of soundfonts, stored in .sf2 files, to provide programs. Many
 soundfonts are configured to resemble either GM or XG, and the programs
 they contain are accessed the same way, as though QSynth were a GM or
 XG synth. Other soundfonts use other arrangements, and there are few
 fast rules. For example, I have a soundfont that only plays a
 harpsichord, no matter what channel I use, and another one that plays
 drums, but only works on channel 10. Rosegarden can read most of this
 information from soundfonts, so soundfont users will have less to worry
 about when it comes time to set up their studio.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_6">11.6 The Odd Ducks</A></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">A great deal of the
 equipment out there falls into none of these categories. Pipe organs
 are especially bizarre creatures from what I hear. Older synths from
 the '80s tend to receive on fewer than 16 channels. Some synths are not
 multi-timbral, and some are monophonic. Many pieces of equipment just
 don't have any sort of program/patch system that lends itself to
 referring to programs by name, so it's more useful to use numbers
 instead. There are also software synths that don't seem to react to
 program changes at all, such as ZynAddSubFX and Hydrogen.</P>

You need to understand and be aware of the capabilities of whatever
 you're using before you can configure your studio effectively. The best
 advice for is to read the supplied documentation and see what its
 capabilities are. Documentation for used MIDI equipment can frequently
 be found online. Of course, when all else fails, you're left with trial
 and error.</P>

<H1>A First Look (under construction)</H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and
control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you
name tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate
segments, and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain
these concepts in more detail later on.) This is also where you
configure segment parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time
signature settings exist a composition level, and they may be edited
here in the main window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_2"></A>Special Toolbars</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of
the first things you might notice about Rosegarden is that there are
several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the
usual standard controls shared by most KDE applications,</P>

there are several toolbars specific to Rosegarden. You'll choose

<H2 CLASS="western">The Tracklist</H2>
<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist
is a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
different parameters. Each track has a label and an output
assignment, and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either
MIDI or audio data, but never both.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Instrument vs. Name</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The tracklist can be configured to
display either the name you've assigned to the track, or the name of
the instrument to which it is connected. Toggle this behavior with
<B>Settings -&gt; Show Track Labels</B>. I will explain more about
this later on, in <A HREF="../en/chapter-4.html#5 Managing Instruments (under construction)|outline">Managing
Instrument Parameters</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here we see how instrument
assignments are displayed on the tracklist. In this example, the
tracks are configured to play using instruments #1 and #2,
respectively, on the &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; device.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/track-list-connections.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Track LEDs</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here we see the labels.
One track has not yet had a name assigned, so it remains
&quot;&lt;untitled&gt;&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Each track has two LEDs.
The blue one is the track mute. If the blue LED is glowing, the track
will be heard during playback. All of the blue LEDs can be turned on
or off all at once with <B>Tracks -&gt; Mute All </B>and <B>-&gt;
Un-Mute All</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The red LED lights up to

can be used to move tracks up and down, to delete them, or to create
new tracks. It is not possible to copy an entire track.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="2_3"></A>
Segments and Segment Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
compositions are made up of <B>segments</B>, and editing at the
composition level involves dragging them around and rearranging them
within tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold
either MIDI events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to
layers in an image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut,
pasted, split, re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at
will, and are very flexible. While there are, understandably, some
differences in the way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be
manipulated in almost exactly the same way within the composition.
The only real limitation is that audio segments and MIDI segments
cannot both play in the same track.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Creating a New Segment</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You can begin recording (audio or MIDI) to create a segment, but I'll
get into that a bit later. For now, why not draw one from scratch?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" NAME="Graphic65" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>

length:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
a segment exists, you can open it with one of the three editors. I
will return to that idea later on.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_79e4c412.png" NAME="Graphic72" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor to split one of the segments, then switch to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5b745bd6.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
and drag one of the pieces so that it overlaps the segment on the
other track. By default, this will snap to whole beat positions
within the bar, but you can override that behavior by holding down
the shift key while dragging.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be
a bit tricky, but once accomplished, you can use <B>Segments -&gt;
Join</B> to combine several segments into one, rather like flattening
the layers in an image editing program.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
This can also merge MIDI events from several different tracks into a
single segment. The events will combine, and merge onto a segment on
whichever track is currently active.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Audio segments can be split and resized, but they cannot be joined or
merged. If you split an audio segment, you can undo that operation to
revert it to its original state, but you cannot, for example, cut out
the middle and splice the ends back together. Neither can you merge
two overlapping audio segments into one, nor merge audio and MIDI
segments together.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Split by Pitch</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts.
You can use <B>Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B>
and then make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc.
from the resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split
the segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up
with treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble
part.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/main-split-by-pitch.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Once split, the two segments will overlap exactly on the same
track. It is impossible to select a segment that lies completely
underneath another segment, so it is probably a good idea to move one
of the two halves into a different track.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Segment Previews</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like just by
looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual aid when
dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on
with <B>Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. This displays a
miniature &ldquo;piano roll&rdquo; for MIDI segments, and a drawing
of the wave form for audio segments.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-previews.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=143 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Segment Parameters</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">After you
have created a segment, you can edit various parameters from the
<B>Segment Parameters</B> box to the left:

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Every segment can have a unique label and color. In this example,
I've chosen the most obvious color to use for this French horn part,
but colors are entirely user-configurable, and these defaults are
only suggestions. I'll explain how to configure custom colors later
on, in the Studio chapter.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Repeats</H3>
<P>Every segment can be made to repeat. It will keep repeating until
the end of the document, or until another segment is encountered in
the track; whichever comes first. These are displayed between repeat
signs ( |: :| ) in the notation editor.</P>
<P>You can turn all repeats into copies at once with <B>Segments -&gt;
Turn Repeats into Copies</B>, or you can turn individual repeats into
copies by double clicking on the light colored repeat rectangles.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-repeats-copies.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Segment Quantizer</H3>
<P>Changing the setting in this box will immediately quantize all
notes in this segment to the selected grid position. It will move the
start times forward or back to align them with the next closest beat
at the desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any
way.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Transposing Instruments</H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
dial a transposition setting into the <B>Transpose</B> box. This will
cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical
Bb trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this
subject in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Delay</H3>
<P>The <B>Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a
segment out of sync on purpose. This can be useful in various ways,
and it's especially amusing for transforming a nicely performed MIDI
file into a simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Getting Around in the Composition</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you've been following along thus
far, you don't actually have anything useful to play. This might be a
good time to load one of the sample files from the Rosegarden
Library. The first time you use the <B>File -&gt; Open</B> menu, you
should be looking at the Library. If not, there should be an icon in
the SpeedBar that will direct you to these files.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>PLUG: The highlighted
file is my own creation. &quot;Perfect Moment&quot; is the name of a
yellow rose, incidentally. As it happens, that is actually the only
original composition I have ever done with Rosegarden. I have spent
so much time writing, programming, and testing that I have had little
time for my own musical pursuits. This file uses the new XSynth-DSSI
analog synth plugin for two parts.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Playback Pointer</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Notice that there's a vertical blue bar running vertically across the
segment canvas. That bar is the playback pointer, and as it sweeps
across the canvas, you'll hear the events as it passes over them.</P>

it at any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along the

The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the

The solo button forces the Transport to play only whatever track is
currently selected at the moment, independent of its mute state. (To
&quot;solo&quot; more than one part, you'll need to set the mute for
tracks individually, or by using <B>Tracks -&gt; Mute All Tracks</B>
and then un-muting the parts you desire.)</P>

the main window.</P>
<P>The tempo ruler changes color to indicate changes in tempo. When a
change occurs, the tempo is displayed along the top half of the

Issuing this command summons the marker editor dialog. In this

<H2 CLASS="western">Miscellany</H2>
<P>There are a few main window features that don't quite fit in
anywhere else, yet which bear special mention.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Importing and Merging Other Compositions</H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Several options are available for
importing and merging material from other sources.  On the <B>File -&gt;
Import</B> menu, you can import standard MIDI files (<B>*.mid</B>)
and Hydrogen <B>(*.h2song)</B> files.  On the <B>File -&gt; Merge</B>
menu, you can merge these and other data sources (including native
Rosegarden composition (<B>*.rg</B>) files) into the existing
composition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">[unfinished &ndash; add a bit about
working with Hydrogen patterns either here or perhaps in the matrix
chapter, dealing with importing/merging them and then either playing
them with hydrogen or else rearranging them in the matrix to play on
a more standard drum kit.  Probably the latter.]</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Autosave</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
If you have a power outage or the like, the next time you start
Rosegarden and attempt to load the file you were working on, you'll
be presented with the option of loading the autosave file instead. If
you hadn't yet saved the file, you'll find it in your ~/autosave
directory with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
Settings menu. If you notice Rosegarden grabbing a lot of your CPU
time for no apparent reason, it's probably autosave, and you might
want to increase the interval, or turn this feature completely off. 
It can become quite cumbersome when working on very large
compositions.  This feature was frankly more useful when Rosegarden
was young, and unstable.</P>

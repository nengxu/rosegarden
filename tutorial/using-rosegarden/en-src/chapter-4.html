<BODY LANG="en-US" DIR="LTR">
<H1>The Studio (final)</H1>
<P>Now that you have a general idea how Rosegarden works, now is a
good time to think about telling Rosegarden something about the MIDI
equipment you wish to use. People who intend to use Rosegarden purely
for audio work are free to skip this chapter entirely.</P>
<P>Before we get started, some of you might need some basic
background information so that you can dive into this with some
understanding of the concepts I am about to explain. If you are new
to MIDI, or if anything in this chapter leaves you scratching your
head, you might want to read through my MIDI Primer in Appendix A.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is a Studio?</H2>
<P>Every native Rosegarden composition (<B>.rg</B>) file contains a
studio definition in addition to all the nuts and bolts stuff of
music. The studio is a definition of every MIDI device Rosegarden can
detect during the course of editing the composition. (Everything that
was there at the start, plus any new devices that become available
during the course of editing; as when starting something like
ZynAddSubFX in the middle of working on a composition, for example.)
It comprises information about the device itself, and about how data
is routed into or out of it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What is a Connection?</H3>
<P>Rosegarden has an integrated MIDI router to manage the flow of raw
MIDI events into and out of ports provided by the underlying ALSA
infrastructure. You can think of this as something like the sort of
router often used to share a broadband internet connection. Unlike
ethernet, however, MIDI is not bidirectional over the same cable. As
a consequence of this, all connections in Rosegarden are
unidrectional; even if both connections belong to the same physical
piece of hardware. Connections will be displayed as one of &quot;read,&quot;
&quot;write,&quot; or &quot;duplex.&quot; In this diagram,
connections are represented by black arrows that point in the
direction data will flow through them. Rosegarden's MIDI router
allows you to rearrange these connections as you require, to change
what is connected where.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-midi-router.jpg" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What is a Device?</H3>
<P>A device is a sort of virtual model of an individual piece of MIDI
equipment. Equipment, in this sense, can be full-fledged external
MIDI hardware, internal hardware like the Sound Blaster Live!, or
virtual hardware like QSynth or VKeybd. Each device encapsulates
information about the capabilities of a piece of equipment, and
allows you to make use of those capabilities from within Rosegarden.
In effect, the better the job you do of describing a particular
device in Rosegarden, the better control you will have over that
device.</P>
<P>For example, if you have a nice keyboard attached to your
computer, but you accept Rosegarden's default General MIDI device
definition for it, you will be unable to make use of any of the
keyboard's advanced features from within Rosegarden until you make
your device definition more accurate. Conversely, telling Rosegarden
you have a Roland JV-88 does not make it so, and if you assign any
<B>instruments</B> to programs that are not actually available on the
connected equipment, you will hear no sound. (More about instruments
in the next chapter.)</P>
<P>A device like the following is typical of either QSynth or a Sound
Blaster Live! after loading an uncomplicated soundfont. It includes a
basic set of controllers (which are dependent on the capabilities of
either QSynth or the Sound Blaster, both of which do support a
limited number of controllers, and actually have nothing to do with
the soundfont per se), a set of standard General MIDI programs loaded
into bank 0 0, and a set of Roland GS-style extra drum kits loaded
into bank 1 0.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-play-device.jpg" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=408 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Putting Connections and Devices Together</H3>
<P>A studio can consist of just one device, and perhaps for many of
you that is all the complexity you will ever need. The real power,
however, lies with Rosegarden's ability to manage numerous devices
simultaneously. A studio is, in effect, a collection of device
descriptions and a routing table ensuring that the right devices are
connected to the right MIDI equipment on the other end.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">A Simple Sound Blaster Live! Studio</H4>
<P>Even on the comparatively simple and very inexpensive end of the
hardware spectrum, it is quite possible to have more than one device
to manage. The Sound Blaster Live! falls into this category, with
four separate write connections available, and four separate play
devices. (Actually, there are five write connections once you include
the duplex external MIDI port, but that is not depicted here.) They
all share the same soundfont on the hardware side, but Rosegarden
doesn't know that until you configure the studio that way, by loading
programs out of the soundfont into each of the four play devices.
(More on that last point in a moment.)</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-sb-live.jpg" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=426 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">A Typical QSynth Studio</H4>
<P>Another typical, simple setup involves using QSynth for MIDI
playback and VKeybd for input. You can start either of these after
starting Rosegarden, and Rosegarden will detect them and make a play
connection and a record connection available, along with an empty
play device.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-simple.jpg" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=461 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">A More Complex Studio</H4>
<P>This is what my own studio looks like when I have QSynth,
Hydrogen, and ZynAddSubFX running, along with my Roland Sound Canvas
and my Sound Blaster Live!. It looks horribly complex on paper, and
it would look even worse if I drew out every single bank of GS
variations, and did a better job of representing the fact that, while
the same soundfont happens to be loaded into both the Sound Blaster
and QSynth, that doesn't <I>have</I> to be the case. No matter how it
looks, this is actually quite simple to use day to day, believe it or
not. Rosegarden makes this easy.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Notice that I have controllers for the
Sound Blaster, for QSynth, and for the Roland (the &quot;External
MIDI GS Synth&quot;), but I do not have any controllers defined for
Hydrogen or ZynAddSubFX. That's because, to the best of my knowledge,
neither of those soft synths knows how to do anything with
controllers. They both have their own control panels that must be
twiddled manually, and that sort of thing can't be automated from
within Rosegarden.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-complex.jpg" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=590 BORDER=0></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Enough Theory Already! How Do I Configure MY
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Studio?</SPAN></H2>
<P>I'm glad you asked. The first step in this process is to open the
main Studio dialog. <B>Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt; Manage MIDI
Devices...</B> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
or by clicking on the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-icon.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
icon.</P>
<P>You'll be presented with a dialog that resembles this one, except,
of course, that this one has already largely been configured to suit
my own default studio. It is divided into two sections; one for play
devices, and one for record devices, and their associated
connections. It also shows you how each of these devices is connected
to internal, external, and software synths. In this example, I have a
device named &quot;Roland SC-33&quot; connected to &quot;64:0 EMU101K
MPU-401 (UART) (duplex)&quot; and four &quot;SB Live (?)&quot;
devices connected to each of 65:0 through 65:3, which are the four
output ports on my SB Live!, with their associated write connections.
I also have three generic spots reserved for soft synths, named &quot;Soft
Synth 1&quot; through &quot;Soft Synth 3&quot;, one of which is
currently connected to KAMix, an ALSA mixer client that can be
controlled via MIDI. These are empty devices that I created with the
<B>New</B> button.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/manage-devices-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=307 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Connections</H3>
<P>The reality of Rosegarden's MIDI router is a bit less intuitive
than the diagram I presented earlier. Here is that same diagram with
the ALSA port numbers included.</P>
<P><I>NOTE: The diagram does not exactly represent the same set of
devices and connections depicted in the dialog box snapshot above.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-diagram-midi-router-with-ports.jpg" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>You might wonder about the strange names and numbers. ALSA assigns
numbers to ports in three ranges. 64: means it is an external MIDI
port on the first soundcard, which might be connected to a MIDI
keyboard, sound module, or other noise producing gadget through some
sort of cable. 65: means it is a virtual port with a supported
internal synth such as the Sound Blaster Live! on the other side.
Software synths like Hydrogen, ZynAddSubFX and the like will take
numbers at the time they're started, on a first-come, first served
basis starting at 128:. In addition to the number, most of these will
have some kind of vaguely descriptive text component, such as
&quot;Emu10k1 Port 0 (write).&quot; These names are provided by the
underlying kernel driver, and don't always make a lot of sense.
That's why Rosegarden allows you give your devices a proper name.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Record Devices</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Record devices are MIDI keyboards, virtual keyboards, MIDI guitars
and the like. As record devices are rather less complicated, I will
cover them first. With a record device, you have no capabilities to
describe. The only thing Rosegarden can do is read data from it, or
not. You may name these if you wish, but the <B>Record devices</B>
section of this dialog is the only place where you will see the
names, and I never bother to name mine.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Rosegarden can record from any number of inputs simultaneously. It
will create a record device for every read connection it detects.
Each of these can be set to be an active record device by toggling
the associated checkbox. Rosegarden keeps track of which port the
recorded data came from, and what channel was used to transmit the
data, but it does not currently do anything with this information.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
In this example, I have both a hardware record device and a software
record device. These devices were created spontaneously when
Rosegarden detected the associated duplex read and virtual read
connections. I have marked both of them &quot;Current&quot; and I can
record events from either one of them, or both of them at the same
time.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-record-devices.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=77 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
<I>NOTE: Rosegarden does not always automatically mark a record
device as &quot;Current.&quot; If you have a keyboard or similar
device, and Rosegarden isn't recording anything, this dialog is the
first place to look for troubleshooting the problem.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><B>Play Devices</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Play devices are where all the fun, and all the complexity is. As I
have mentioned elsewhere, they can be MIDI keyboards, sound modules,
software synths, samplers, and pretty well anything else that can
take MIDI input, such as KAMix. (Synth plugins are somewhat
different. There is a single synth plugin device into which any and
all plugins are plugged, and it is not a MIDI play device. I will
cover synth plugins in the next chapter.)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The Easy Road (General MIDI Only)</H4>
<P>If you have only one play device, and it only uses straight
General MIDI programs, then you are probably ready to go out of the
box. If you start Rosegarden with no file to open, it opens a default
blank document, called <B>autoload.rg</B>. Initially, this will be
the system default that was installed with Rosegarden. It will load a
set of basic General MIDI programs and controllers, and will route
output from this device to the first available play connection. The
device a the top of the list is always the default device.</P>
<P>Typically this play connection will be routed to the correct
destination for your MIDI data. If not, all you should have to do is
adjust the routing table by dialing appropriate connections into the
associated combo boxes. For example, if Rosegarden defaults to
routing your output to &quot;64:0 (duplex)&quot; and you do not have
any external equipment attached to your computer, you probably want
to change this to point to either 65:0 or something like 128:0 as
appropriate.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The Harder Road (Loading Device Definitions from
the Library)</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
If you have some need beyond the simplest one-device, only-General
MIDI scenario, you will have to use the bank editor; even if you do
not intend to edit any banks directly. To load or create a device
click on the <B>Banks...</B> button to pop up the bank editor dialog.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
In this example, you can see that I have already imported some
programs from the soundfont I use on my SB Live!, and I have named
the four devices &quot;SB Live! (1)&quot; through &quot;SB Live! (4)&quot;
for my own convenience. This soundfont has programs available in four
banks, which are displayed as the branches of the tree. The LSB
column is not visible in this snapshot, but the bank names tell most
of the tale. I named the last one &quot;Percussion&quot; to set it
apart, because that is where this soundfont stores the drum kits.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You can also see that I have a device called &quot;Soft Synth 2&quot;
highlighted, and I'm looking at the empty list of programs that make
up Rosegarden's virtual model for this device. Unlike internal and
external MIDI equipment, Rosegarden assigns connections to soft
synths on a first-come, first serve basis, based on the order in
which the applications are started. It is very easy to wind up with
something named &quot;Hydrogen&quot; that is actually connected to
QSynth. I find I prefer to give these things generic names and assign
the connections manually as required, because I start and stop soft
synths as I need them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-bank-editor.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=340 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Loading a Device from the Library</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If you're
lucky, the growing Rosegarden Library already contains a set of bank
and program definitions to suit your hardware. To try your luck,
click the <B>Import...</B> button. You will initially be presented
with a list of <B>.rgd</B> files from the Library, which was
installed along with Rosegarden itself, but you can, of course,
browse to other locations. You can import banks from both regular
Rosegarden Composition (<B>.rg)</B> files, and from Rosegarden Device
(<B>.rgd)</B> files. If you don't find anything suitable, you will
probably have to start from scratch, as I will explain later on.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Turning a SoundFont into a Device</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">&quot;Soft
Synth 2&quot; in the above example is a soundfont based card or soft
synth. The simplest, most accurate way to define a device model for a
synth of this type is to load the banks of program names directly out
of the soundfont's <B>.sf2</B> file itself. Simply set the &quot;Filter:&quot;
to &quot;Soundfont&quot; and browse to the location of the soundfont
you've loaded into your synth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><I>NOTE:
Defining a device by loading programs out of a soundfont is in no way
related to actually loading that soundfont into either a Sound
Blaster Live! or into QSynth. You are merely reading the directory
inside the  <B>.sf2 </B>file that describes how the various samples
are arranged into banks, and importing that textual information into
Rosegarden. It saves a great deal of typing, and delivers fast,
accurate results.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-import-soundfont.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=211 BORDER=0>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Once You've Made Your Choice</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Regardless
of whether you elected to load a stock device from the Library, or
loaded the programs out of a <B>.sf2</B> file, you will need to make
a few decisions how to procede.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">If the
file contains models of more than one device, you can choose which
one to import. You also have various choices about which bits to
import, and whether to merge new banks into existing ones or replace
them completely. Everything should be self-evident after a little
experimentation.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5_4"></A>The Hardest Road: Creating a
List of Programs from Scratch</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
If none of the device models in the library are suitable, and you
can't turn the program names from a soundfont into a device, then you
will need to get to work creating your own. You can use an existing
file from the library as a starting point, or you can create a new
device definition completely from scratch.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Even if you have no real need to start from scratch, you may wish to
read through this material anyway, in order to better understand how
some of the devices in the Library are put together.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Naming the Device</H5>
<P>So that you can avoid confusion, you probably want to replace
Rosegarden's default &quot;Anonymous MIDI Device 3&quot; type name
with something more meaningful. Simply double click on the existing
name and give your virtual model a more descriptive one.</P>
<P>Now that your &quot;Anonymous External Device&quot; has become a
&quot;Roland SC-33&quot; or what have you, you probably want add a
description of its available programs and controllers to Rosegarden's
model.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Why Name Programs and Controllers?</H5>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Depending on the capabilities of this device, it might not matter
whether you define named program changes or not. However, if you do
intend to transmit programs, bank changes or controllers to the
equipment--even if you only want to use numbers--you need to define
<I>something </I>here. Rosegarden's model of your equipment will only
include what you define here, and anything you leave empty will not
be available for your use. If you don't let Rosegarden know that
program number 97 can play something, it will never allow you set a
track to use that program number.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Gathering Information</H5>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The key to success here is having as much information about the
equipment as possible. You need to know what programs it can use, and
how the banks are numbered. If you have no idea, you may have to try
loading &quot;raw-numbers.rgd&quot; from the Library, which I created
as a way of providing a generic everything to everyone placeholder
just to fill up the slots and allow program changes to be
transmitted. Beyond the essential fact that you must understand your
equipment to describe it, there are really only two special cases
worth mentioning here.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Variations</H5>
<P>Some equipment uses a method of sorting programs into banks in
such a way that the programs in bank 0 0 are the standard General
MIDI instruments, and the programs in the remaining banks are
variations on those instruments. Roland's GS standard is a prime
example of this. Bank 0 0, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1&quot; and bank
0 8, program 1 is &quot;Piano 1w.&quot; In order to make it easy to
take advantage of this relationship, Rosegarden offers the ability to
display programs in secondary banks as variations. You may choose to
enable this, and to show the variation list based on either the LSB
or MSB value.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-variations.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=261 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">The Percussion Checkbox</H5>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Finally, you may have noticed that Rosegarden only allows you one set
of program changes per bank address. The exception to this rule is
that you may define a parallel set of program changes if the [x]
Percussion box is checked. For example, if you have a synth that
interprets standard program changes in bank 0 0 on channel 10 as drum
kit changes (like GS) then you can tell Rosegarden how to use them.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The process is a bit fiddly. First you have to use the <B>Add </B>button
to create a new, empty bank. It will take a number other than 0 0
because 0 0 is already in use. Check the [x] Percussion box for this
new bank, and then dial its LSB and MSB values back down to 0 0 (or
wherever they need to be for your implementation) and enter the names
of drum kits as programs.</P>

Once you've defined the names for your program changes, you can save
the device definition to disk with the <B>Export... </B>button.</P>

New contributions are most welcome. We pioneers must do all the work
so that future generations can be lazy. Just remember that I had to

time-consuming. Especially since this stuff was a lot more buggy and
incomprehensible back then. ;)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Custom Controllers</H2>
<P>Rosegarden should create a few basic default controllers for you.
If you have special requirements, or if some of these controllers
don't function on the piece of equipment for which you're defining
the device, you may wish to edit these defaults by clicking the
<B>Control Events</B> button.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/control-events.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=345 HEIGHT=259 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If your equipment can't use any of these controllers,
you probably want to delete them. If there are controllers missing,
you can add them one by one. Use the <B>Add</B> button. This will
create a new entry using default values. Double click it, and you
should be presented with a dialog similar to this one.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/studio-controller-editor.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=228 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Most of these parameters
should be obvious to you based on the particular needs of the
equipment you're describing, but the last two bear special mention.
The <B>Color: </B>parameter is the color this controller's knob will
have on the <B>Instrument Parameters </B>box in the main window, and
the <B>position:</B> determines whether this controller will show up,
and how it will be arranged relative to the other controllers. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Default Document Properties</H2>
<P>Before you make this document your default, you might want to have
a look at some other document-specific settings. These aren't a part
of the Studio, but they're saved in <B>autoload.rg</B>, and any new
documents you create will start life with these defaults. To edit
them, use <B>Composition -&gt; Edit -&gt; Document Properties</B>.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Lilypond Headers</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">The About tab starts off
with some default properties. You can modify or delete these, and you
can add new properties. The four defaults will be translated into
Lilypond during an export. If you wish to use any other strings in
your Lilypond headers, you can add them here by creating properties
of that name, then binding your custom strings with them.. For
example, &quot;instrument,&quot; &quot;dedication,&quot; or &quot;poet.&quot;</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Audio Directory</H3>
<P>From the Audio tab, you can configure a new directory for audio
files. Rosegarden will use this path for recording new files, and
it's the first place it will look when you import audio segments. By
default, this is ~/rosegarden. If this path doesn't exist, you won't
be able to record audio, so either create that directory or configure
Rosegarden to look somewhere else here.</P>
<P>You should get in the habit of creating a new audio directory for
each document you create in which you intend to use audio segments,
as I will detail in another chapter.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Custom Colors</H3>
<P>Rosegarden can colorize segments and controllers. Custom colors
are defined here.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="2_5_5"></A>Saving Your Studio as the
Default</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Now that
you've gotten your studio configured, you'll want to make it your
default, so that you can avoid having to go through this entire
ordeal every time you start a new composition. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><B>Composition
-&gt; Studio -&gt; Save Current Document as Default Studio</B> will
save the current document as your local <B>autoload.rg</B> file. This
becomes the default for all new documents you create, but it will
have no effect on documents that you've already created, or documents
you load from other sources. The studio belongs to each individual
composition.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
This default studio is just like any ordinary <B>.rg</B> file, and
that means any segments, track labels, instrument assignments, etc.
that you have in the current document will be saved, and will
subsequently be loaded each time you create a new document.</P>

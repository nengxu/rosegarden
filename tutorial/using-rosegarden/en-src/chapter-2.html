<H1>A First Look</H1>
<H2>Before You Begin</H2>
<P>Before you start Rosegarden, you might want to make sure your
configuration is in order.  Many users have found that Rosegarden was
unable to produce any sound out of the box.</P>
<P>If you are interested in working with MIDI, you should consider a
few questions.  Do you have a MIDI keyboard attached to your
computer?  Does your soundcard have an internal synth?  Do you have
it working correctly?  Are you going to have to run a software synth
such as QSynth?  Can you play MIDI files (<B>.mid)</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">?</SPAN>
 If you don't know the answers to these questions, you might want to
turn to <A HREF="chapter-9.html/">&quot;MIDI Primer&quot;</A>
and familiarize yourself with these basics.</P>
<P> If you play to use Rosegarden as an audio sequencer, you might do
well to turn to <A HREF="chapter-7.html/">&quot;Starting and
Routing Audio Through JACK&quot;</A> to learn about starting the JACK
audio server, and getting it to cooperate with any software synths
you wish to run. The audio server must be running before you start
Rosegarden in order for Rosegarden's audio features to be enabled.</P>
<P>After working through the material in these two appendices, you
should be  ready to come back here and get started in earnest.</P>
<P>Or, of course, you can jump in headlong, fire this thing up, and
take it for a spin.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and
control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you
name tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate
segments, and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain
these concepts in more detail later on.) This is also where you
configure segment parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time
signature settings exist a composition level, and they may be edited
here in the main window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2_2"></A>Special Toolbars</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">One of
the first things you might notice about Rosegarden is that there are
several toolbars at the top of the main window. In addition to the
usual standard controls shared by most KDE applications,</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">

there are several toolbars specific to Rosegarden. You'll choose
various tools for selecting and manipulating segments from the Tools

<H2>The Tracklist</H2>
<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist
is a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
different parameters. Each track has a label and an output
assignment, and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either
MIDI or audio data, but never both.</P>
<H3>Connection vs. Name</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The tracklist can be configured to
display either the name you've assigned to the track, or the name of
the device and channel to which it is connected. Toggle this behavior
with <B>Settings -&gt; Show Track Labels</B>. I will explain more
about these connections later on, after I have described the Studio.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here we see how connections are
displayed on the tracklist.</P>

<H3>Track LEDs</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here we see the labels.
One track has not yet had a name assigned, so it remains
&quot;&lt;untitled&gt;&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Each track has two LEDs.
The blue one is the track mute. If the blue LED is glowing, the track
will be heard during playback. All of the blue LEDs can be turned on
or off all at once with <B>Tracks -&gt; Mute All </B>and <B>-&gt;
/Un-Mute All</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The red LED lights up to

<P>The tools on the Tracks Toolbar 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_m7a769b12.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
can be used to move tracks up and down, to delete them, or to create
new tracks. It is not possible to copy an entire track.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="2_3"></A>Segments and
Segment Parameters</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
compositions are made up of segments, and editing at the composition
level involves dragging them around and rearranging them within
tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold either MIDI
events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an
image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted,
split, re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will,
and are very flexible. While there are understandably some
differences in the way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be
manipulated in almost exactly the same way within the composition.
The only real limitation is that audio segments and MIDI segments
cannot both play in the same track.</P>
<H3>Creating a New Segment</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You can begin recording (audio or MIDI) to create a segment, but I'll
get into that a bit later. For now, why not draw one from scratch?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" NAME="Graphic65" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>

length:</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">You can
now edit it by way of the matrix or notation views, which we will
address later. For now, let's go ahead and play with the segment.</P>
<H3>Moving and Copying</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5b745bd6.png" NAME="Graphic67" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>

<H3>Splitting and Joining</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_79e4c412.png" NAME="Graphic72" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor to split one of the segments, then switch to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5b745bd6.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
and drag one of the pieces so that it overlaps the segment on the
other track. By default, this will snap to whole beat positions
within the bar, but you can override that behavior by holding down
the shift key while dragging.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_m744cffee.png" NAME="Graphic73" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=451 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be
a bit tricky, but once accomplished, you can use <B>Segments -&gt;
Join</B> to combine several segments into one, rather like flattening
the layers in an image editing program.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
<I>NOTE: As of this writing, when 1.0 is still spoken of in the
future tense, it is not possible to join audio segments in this
fashion. This feature is planned, but may or may not make it in time
for 1.0.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
This can also merge events from several different tracks into a
single segment. The events will combine, and merge onto a segment on
whichever track is currently active. Obviously, you may not merge
MIDI and audio into the same segment.</P>
<H4>Split by Pitch</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts.
You can use <B>Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B>
and then make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc.
from the resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split
the segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up
with treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble
part.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/main-split-by-pitch.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Once split, the two segments will overlap exactly on the same
track. It is impossible to select a segment that lies completely
underneath another segment, so it is probably a good idea to move one
of the two halves into a different track.</P>
<H3>Segment Previews</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like just by
looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual aid when
dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on
with <B>Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. This displays a
miniature &ldquo;piano roll&rdquo; for MIDI segments, and a drawing
of the wave form for audio segments.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-previews.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=143 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Segment Parameters</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">After you
have created a segment, you can edit various parameters from the
<B>Segment Parameters</B> box to the left: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Every segment can have a unique label and color. In this example,
I've chosen the most obvious color to use for this French horn part,
but colors are entirely user-configurable, and these defaults are
only suggestions. I'll explain how to configure custom colors later
on, in the Studio chapter.</P>
<H3>Repeats</H3>
<P>Every segment can be made to repeat. It will keep repeating until
the end of the document, or until another segment is encountered in
the track; whichever comes first. These are displayed between repeat
signs ( |: :| ) in the notation editor.</P>
<P>You can turn all repeats into copies at once with <B>Segments -&gt;
Turn Repeats into Copies</B>, or you can turn individual repeats into
copies by double clicking on the light colored repeat rectangles.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-repeats-copies.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Segment Quantizer</H3>
<P>Changing the setting in this box will immediately quantize all
notes in this segment to the selected grid position. It will move the
start times forward or back to align them with the next closest beat
at the desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any
way.</P>
<H3>Transposing Instruments</H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
dial a transposition setting into the <B>Transpose</B> box. This will
cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical
Bb trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this
subject in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3>Delay</H3>
<P>The <B>Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a
segment out of sync on purpose. This can be useful in various ways,
and it's especially amusing for transforming a nicely performed MIDI
file into a simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>
<H2>Getting Around in the Composition</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you've been following along thus
far, you don't actually have anything useful to play. This is
nevertheless the perfect spot to introduce you to the tools you'll
need to use to move around in the composition.</P>
<H3>The Playback Pointer</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Notice that there's a vertical blue bar running vertically across the
segment canvas. That bar is the playback pointer, and as it sweeps
across the canvas, you'll hear the events as it passes over them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/playback-pointer.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=199 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
While you can't grab it and move it around directly, you can position
it any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along the dark
gray portion of the ruler at the top, or you can use the transport to
move it around. If you don't see it, play with the transport or the
ruler until you coax it out of hiding.</P>
<H3>The Transport</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You should have a separate, floating Transport window like this one.
If it's not visible, then toggle it on with <B>Settings -&gt; Show
Transport</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/transport.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=121 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Most of
these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out what any of
the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and context-sensitive help
will pop up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Of
special note are the panic, metronome, and solo buttons. If they're
missing, toggle the extra controls.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
The panic button transmits a &quot;notes off&quot; message on every
channel. It does not transmit an &quot;all notes off&quot; or a
&quot;system reset&quot; or what have you, but litereally transmits a
notes off on every channel on every device Rosegarden knows about. It
can take quite a long time for all the events to transmit, which you
can see happening by watching the &quot;OUT&quot; area in the
Transport, but it's guaranteed to shut up that droning C# and then
some.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is
a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
composition. Configure it via <B>Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt;
Manage Metronome</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The solo button forces the Transport to play only whatever track is
currently selected at the moment, independent of its mute state. (To
&quot;solo&quot; more than one part, you'll need to set the mute for
tracks individually, or by using <B>Tracks -&gt; Mute All Tracks</B>
and then un-muting the parts you desire.)</P>
<H2>Time and Tempo</H2>
<P>As I mentioned, the time signature and tempo are global to the
entire composition. I'll discuss another way to manipulate these in
<A HREF="chapter-7.html/">Chapter 7</A>, but here and now you
can manipulate both time signature and tempo to your heart's content
from the main window.</P>
<P>The tempo ruler changes color to indicate changes in tempo. When a
change occurs, the tempo is displayed along the top half of the
ruler, and the time signature is displayed across the bottom. If you
double click this ruler, the Tempo and Time Signature editor will
appear.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/time-tempo-editor.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=228 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>New Tempo</H3>
<P>To add a new tempo, click the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-icon.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>
icon, and you'll be presented with a dialog like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-add.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>By default, new events you add here will be inserted at
the point in time where you clicked to open the Tempo and Time
Signature editor. You can change this by adjusting the &quot;Time of
tempo change&quot; parameters, if you wish.</P>
<H3>New Time Signature</H3>
<P>Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-time-icon.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0>
icon, and you'll be presented with a dialog like:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-time-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=282 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can display the time signature as cut or common
time, and make the time signature hidden. You should probably always
leave &quot;Correct the durations of the following measures&quot;
checked unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. 
</P>
<H2>Autosave</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that
doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always, &quot;save early, save
often&quot; is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and can't be
stressed enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your
work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a power outage or the
like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the file
you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of loading
the autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file, you'll
find it in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
Settings menu.</P>

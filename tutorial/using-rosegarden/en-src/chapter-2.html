<H1>Producing Sound</H1>
<P>Many users have written to ask why they are unable to get
Rosegarden to make any noise. It is the most common question asked on
the rosegarden-user mailing list by far, and is especially
troublesome for those newly migrating to Linux from Windows. Before
we start Rosegarden for the first time, I want to explain what is
necessary to pave the way, and have a good first experience.  Some of
you already know all this, and those of you who do are invited to
jump ahead to the next chapter, where the interesting part begins.</P>
<P>The topic of sound covers two distinct areas that may or may not
be codependent, depending on the hardware and software you have
available. One the one hand, there are several requirements that must
be met in order to play MIDI with Rosegarden, and on the other, it's
necessary to get the JACK server up and running reliably in order to
make use of Rosegarden's audio features. A working JACK server is
also required to play MIDI with synth plugins, or to play more than
one ALSA software synth at a time. Getting Rosegarden to make noise
can be a complicated business, but hopefully I can help you deal with
whatever set of circumstances you have before you.  I cannot,
however, cover every detail of getting every card working with every
distribution.  I'm afraid I have to leave some questions unanswered,
lest this chapter become a book unto itself. 
</P>
<P>Here is a roadmap showing all the possible ways to produce sound
with Rosegarden at a glance. It's quite daunting, I know, but I hope
I can help you make sense of it:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="sound-diagram/sound-diagram-master.jpg" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=530 HEIGHT=505 BORDER=0></P>
<H2>Playing MIDI</H2>
<P>MIDI under Linux is quite a complicated subject. The available
hardware falls into three broad categories, each with its own special
considerations. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">External MIDI hardware</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#5c8526">internal hardware with ALSA support</FONT>, and
internal hardware without ALSA support.  The latter category splits
into <FONT COLOR="#9966cc">ALSA soft synths</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#5e11a6">synth
plugins</FONT>, which are similar, but slightly different.</P>
<H3>External MIDI Interfaces</H3>
<P>By far the least complicated, and most expensive way to play MIDI
under Linux is to use real MIDI equipment. This can include
keyboards, sound modules, and perhaps even MIDI guitars. A wide range
of equipment is available for this purpose, ranging from
comparatively inexpensive consumer keyboards to professional quality
gear. The cost ranges from hundreds to thousands of dollars however,
and this is not the way to go unless you are serious about MIDI.</P>
<P>If you're fortunate enough to have such equipment, then you
probably already have some idea how to hook it up to your computer.
If the equipment has the ability to produce sound on its own, as some
MIDI keyboards do, then you may wish to use those speakers for MIDI
playback.  If your MIDI equipment has no speakers, or if you intend
to record the audio output from this equipment, you may wish to
connect the audio output from your keyboard or sound module to an
audio input jack on your soundcard.  This will allow you to route
everything through the <FONT COLOR="#ff8080">soundcard's mixer</FONT>.
There are several choices for external MIDI interfaces.</P>
<H4>Joystick Port MIDI Adapters</H4>
<P>The simplest, least expensive route is the joystick port MIDI
adapter. These are found on many common, low-end soundcards, such as
the Sound Blaster PCI 128 (snd-ens1371). It can be somewhat difficult
to obtain a suitable Y-cable or MIDI box to connect to these things,
but after having obtained one, all that remains is to connect your
equipment using standard 5-pin DIN MIDI cables. With the snd-ens1371
driver, and those for many similar cards, it's only a matter of
making sure the <B>snd-seq-midi </B>and <B>snd-rawmidi</B> drivers
are loaded (using whatever mechanism your particular distribution
provides for that function.)</P>
<H4>Midi Port Cards</H4>
<H4>USB MIDI Interfaces</H4>
<H3>MIDI without External Hardware</H3>
<P>For those without external hardware to use, there are two
remaining categories. A few soundcards have built-in MIDI
infrastructure that ALSA can use. Everyone else will have to use some
kind of software synth.</P>
<H4>Cards with Synth Support under ALSA</H4>
<P>This is the next easiest way to get MIDI working. So far as I
know, this category only applies to those with soundcards based on an
Emu chipset, such as the Sound Blaster Live!/Audigy series
(snd-emu10k1), and the AWE 32/64 (snd-emu8000).  I have a Sound
Blaster Live! Value Edition myself, and can report that it's easy to
get working, and it sounds reasonably decent.</P>
<H5>SB Live! Modules</H5>
<P>First, you'll need to ensure you have the proper kernel modules
loaded, and that you are using the ALSA modules, which have &quot;snd&quot;
in the name.  I have the following modules loaded for my own SB
Live!:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-oss
snd-seq-midi snd-emu10k1-synth snd-emux-synth </FONT>
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-emu10k1

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-hwdep
snd-util-mem snd-page-alloc snd-ac97-codec</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-rawmidi
snd-seq-device snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<H5>Set the Mixer Volume</H5>
<P>Next, you'll need to check to make sure you've turned up your
mixer volumes.  I will cover this card's rather complicated mixer in
detail when I talk about managing various inputs and outputs for the
purpose of audio recording.  For the moment, it should be sufficient
to ensure the &quot;Music&quot; channel volume is turned up.  My
mixer of preference is <A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~mana/kalsatools.html">KAmix</A>.
 Unfortunately, it is not widely available outside of SuSE, and you
may have to compile it yourself.  It isn't the prettiest mixer, but
it's the only one I've found that lets me control my SB Live!
consistently and efficiently to get the results I want.</P>
<H5>Load a SoundFont</H5>
<P>Finally, you'll need to load a soundfont into the card.  These
cards use .sf2 soundfonts that are readily available.  I'm not aware
of a soundfont free enough to be included with any distribution of
Linux, so you will most likely have to obtain one from the web, or
perhaps from the CDs that came with your soundcard.  I have had good
luck with soundfonts from the <A HREF="http://www.personalcopy.com/linuxfiles.htm">Personal
Copy</A> website, but I make no warranty expressed or implied about
the suitability or legality of their soundfonts, or any other
soundfonts you might obtain on the web for any particular purpose.</P>
<P>Once you have obtained a soundfont, you need to load it into the
card.  There isn't currently any user-friendly way of managing this. 
I'm developing a utility for this very purpose, but I did not have
time to finish it before releasing this book, and so I will make no
reference to it.  In the meantime, your two choices are to run the
command line utility <B><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">asfxload</FONT></B>,
or to configure Rosegarden to load a soundfont for you at startup,
via <B>Settings -&gt; Configure Rosegarden -&gt;  Sequencer -&gt;
General</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/configure-soundfont.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=280 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4>Cards without Synth Support under ALSA</H4>
<P>This is really the &quot;everything else&quot; category.  It
includes too many soundcards to list, each with its own set of
modules.  The Sound Blaster PCI and Ensoniq AudioPCI cards (ens-1370,
ens-1371, ens-1373), and integrated snd-intel8x0 and snd-via82xx are
probably the most common, but soundcards that fall into this category
are legion.  The process for getting them to play MIDI is similar in
all cases.</P>
<H5>Check your Modules</H5>
<P>First, you need to ensure you have the necessary ALSA MIDI
infrastructure by loading the following modules in addition to
whatever other modules you require for your particular hardware:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-seq-midi
snd-seq-virmidi snd-seq-midi-event snd-seq</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">snd-timer
snd-rawmidi snd soundcore</FONT></P>
<P><I>(The above list was extrapolated from the previous SB Live!
example, and may contain modules that won't actually load with your
particular hardware.  If loading one or more of the above modules
fails, don't worry about it unless you later find your MIDI subsystem
doesn't work.)</I></P>
<H5>QSynth</H5>
<P>The least complicated way to get one of these cards to play MIDI
is to use <A HREF="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/">QSynth</A>.  It is
a simple to use ALSA soft synth  that takes MIDI data as input and
uses <B>.sf2</B> format soundfonts to produce audio output.  In its
simplest configuration, it can use ALSA for audio output, avoiding
the need to run JACK.  If you already need or want to run JACK, it
can connect its output to JACK instead.  In this configuration, you
can also use a variety of other ALSA soft synths such as <A HREF="http://hydrogen.sourceforge.net/">Hydrogen</A>
and <A HREF="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">ZynAddSubFX</A>,
all sharing the same audio output.  QSynth is the most useful for
general music production, and so it is my focus here.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-main.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=117 BORDER=0></P>
<H6>Configure the Audio Driver</H6>
<P>The first decision you need to make is whether to use ALSA or JACK
for output.  I will cover starting and configuring JACK in detail in
a moment.  No matter which option you choose, both are configured via
the <B>Setup</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> button.  In this
example, I'm using JACK.  Take special note that I have adjusted the
sample rate to match the sample rate I'm using with JACK, which is
48,000 Hz (for reasons I will explain directly.)  Also note that I
have checked </SPAN><B>[x] Auto Connect JACK Outputs</B>.  This
allows QSynth to make its own default connection with JACK, which is
very convenient.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-audio-setup.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=342 BORDER=0></P>
<H6>Loading a SoundFont</H6>
<P>Finally, it's necessary to load at least one soundfont.  These are
the same <B>.sf2</B> soundfonts used by the SB Live! series of cards,
and they are loaded via a different tab on the same setup page.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qsynth-soundfonts.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=343 BORDER=0></P>
<H5>SynthPlugins</H5>
<P>It is also possible to play using synth plugins.  There is a
FluidSynth-DSSI plugin that provides essentially the same
functionality as QSynth, except that it's integrated directly into
Rosegarden.  I will describe it in detail when I talk about assigning
instruments to tracks, because its configuration and use is entirely
internal to Rosegarden.  For the moment it is sufficient to know that
it exists, and that it requires a working JACK server in order to
function.</P>
<H2>Playing Audio</H2>
<P>In order to play audio you will need to run JACK. 
</P>
<P>JACK is short for the &ldquo;Jack Audio Connection Kit.&rdquo;
JACK is a flexible audio server that allows its client applications
to share the audio hardware seamlessly, and to share a common
transport. It provides flexible mechanisms for routing inputs and
outputs to and from client applications using a jack-and-cable
metaphor. It is geared toward the audio professional who wants to get
the lowest possible latency and the best possible performance out of
his or her hardware, but professional or not, it's something you need
to come to terms with JACK if you want to play audio with Rosegarden.</P>
<P>Some of you may have heard of patching kernels, running with
&quot;capabilities,&quot; and other arcane magic associated with
Linux audio.  All of that really <B>is</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
necessary to get the best performance out of JACK, I'm afraid.  It's
a very complicated business that I don't understand very well myself.
 I fear I must leave you in the hands of <A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">AGNULA</A></SPAN>
and perhaps the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/subscribeall.php3">Linux
Audio Users</A> list for more information if you require more
performance than you can by following these simple instructions to
get JACK running as an ordinary user on an ordinary kernel.</P>
<H3>Starting and Tweaking JACK</H3>
<P>The simplest way to control your JACK server is to use <A HREF="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">qjackctl</FONT></SPAN></A>.
It is a very useful utility that provides a convenient way to start
and stop your JACK server, to play with various configuration
parameters to find the best combination for your hardware, and to
manage JACK connections between applications.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-overview.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=106 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Configuring the JACK Server</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">To change how your JACK
server is configured, use the <B>Setup</B> button.  The process that
follows will probably be tedious and time-consuming, but once you
have discovered the &quot;magic numbers&quot; for your hardware,
everything should continue to work thereafter.  Discovering the best
combination is a process of playing with the &quot;Frames/Period&quot;,
&quot;Sample Rate&quot; and &quot;Periods/Buffer&quot; settings. 
Your objective here is to find the lowest possible latency, as
reported in the lower right-hand corner of the dialog.  As you change
settings, this number will show the results yielded by that
combination.  You want the sample rate high, and the frames/periods
and periods/buffer low.  I suggest you dial up the lowest possible
latency, click on <B>OK</B>, then try to start the JACK server with
the <B>Start</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> button on the main
dialog</SPAN>.  If the server fails to start, come back to this
dialog and keep working up until you find a combination that works.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-silvan.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=387 BORDER=0></P>
<H4>The Evil XRUN</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">It's very important to
avoid xruns.  If you find a combination of low-latency settings that
allow the JACK server to start, but which produce a flood of xruns,
you're aiming too high.  Xruns are reported in the main QJackCtl
dialog.  Ideally, you should see this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-no-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=69 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If, on the other hand, you
see something like this, you have trouble ahead:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/JACK-know-xruns.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=113 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You never want to see this
much red. Seeing any red at all is really unacceptable.  Xruns cause
audio dropouts.  Clicks, pops, distortions, flanger-like effects. 
They are to be avoided at all costs.  If you cannot produce a set of
parameters that gets JACK running without xruns, you probably have no
choice but to explore the world of Linux audio performance tweaking. 
Even eliminating the xruns is no guarantee that you will be able to
obtain acceptable performance running these things as an ordinary
user.  My own performance is just barely good enough that I can't
quite force myself to dive into the arcane world of Linux audio
headlong.</P>
<H3>Managing JACK Connections</H3>
<P>Rosegarden will establish sane default connections automatically. 
So will QSynth and Hydrogen, if you've configured them to do so. 
ZynAddSubFX and perhaps other JACK-aware applications do not do this.
 To see and change the connections, click on the <B>Connections</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
button.  Making or breaking connections is a process of highlighting
one or more items in the left pane and one or more items in the right
pane, then using the </SPAN><B>Connect</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
or </SPAN><B>Disconnect</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> buttons
as required.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/qjackctl-connections.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=306 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE:  You can also use
QJackCtl to manage ALSA MIDI connections.  I do not recommend that
you do so while you are running Rosegarden.  Rosegarden has its own
internal MIDI router, and it doesn't work properly if you change MIDI
connections externally.  However, if, for example, you want to play
your Sound Blaster Live! or QSynth with your MIDI keyboard without
running Rosegarden, you can use QJackCtl's MIDI connection manager to
hook it up.</I></P>
<H1>A First Look (under construction)</H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Let's begin by starting Rosegarden, and having a look at the main
window. This is where you get an overall view of your work, and
control a number of settings and parameters.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_1"></A>The Main Window</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
A Rosegarden document is called a composition. The main window is
primarily dedicated to editing at the composition level, so most of
these tools affect your document in a broad way. This is where you
name tracks and assign instruments to them, create and manipulate
segments, and watch a broad overview of playback. (I will explain
these concepts in more detail later on.) This is also where you
configure segment parameters such as label and color. Tempo and time
signature settings exist a composition level, and they may be edited
here in the main window using the tempo ruler.</P>

<H2>The Tracklist</H2>
<P>Rosegarden is a track-based sequencer. Each entry in the tracklist
is a separate track that can have individualized settings for several
different parameters. Each track has a label and an output
assignment, and can be used to record, play, and manipulate either
MIDI or audio data, but never both.</P>
<H3>Connection vs. Name</H3>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Rosegarden
compositions are made up of segments, and editing at the composition
level involves dragging them around and rearranging them within
tracks. Segments are a universal container that may hold either MIDI
events or audio data. Segments are rather similar to layers in an
image editing program such as the GIMP. They can be cut, pasted,
split, re-combined, overlapped and pretty much rearranged at will,
and are very flexible. While there are understandably some
differences in the way audio and MIDI segments behave, they can be
manipulated in almost exactly the same way within the composition.
The only real limitation is that audio segments and MIDI segments
cannot both play in the same track.</P>

address later. For now, let's go ahead and play with the segment.</P>
<H3>Moving and Copying</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">

<H3>Splitting and Joining</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_79e4c412.png" NAME="Graphic72" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor to split one of the segments, then switch to the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5b745bd6.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
and drag one of the pieces so that it overlaps the segment on the
other track. By default, this will snap to whole beat positions
within the bar, but you can override that behavior by holding down
the shift key while dragging.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_m744cffee.png" NAME="Graphic73" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=451 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Highlighting the smaller of two overlapping segments can sometimes be
a bit tricky, but once accomplished, you can use <B>Segments -&gt;
Join</B> to combine several segments into one, rather like flattening
the layers in an image editing program.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
<I>NOTE: As of this writing, when 1.0 is still spoken of in the
future tense, it is not possible to join audio segments in this
fashion. This feature is planned, but may or may not make it in time
for 1.0.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
This can also merge events from several different tracks into a
single segment. The events will combine, and merge onto a segment on
whichever track is currently active. Obviously, you may not merge
MIDI and audio into the same segment.</P>
<H4>Split by Pitch</H4>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
If you have a segment where the treble and bass parts are jumbled
together, you might wish to split this at middle C or thereabouts.
You can use <B>Segments -&gt; Split and Join -&gt; Split by Pitch</B>
and then make your selections for split point, clef handling, etc.
from the resulting dialog. By default, this feature attempts to split
the segment intelligently, so that you can hopefully avoid winding up
with treble notes in the bass part, and bass notes in the treble
part.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/main-split-by-pitch.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Once split, the two segments will overlap exactly on the same
track. It is impossible to select a segment that lies completely
underneath another segment, so it is probably a good idea to move one
of the two halves into a different track.</P>
<H3>Segment Previews</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
You can get some sense of what that bit of music is like just by
looking at the segment display, which is a useful visual aid when
dragging things around. If this feature is not turned on, turn it on
with <B>Settings -&gt; Segment Previews</B>. This displays a
miniature &ldquo;piano roll&rdquo; for MIDI segments, and a drawing
of the wave form for audio segments.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-previews.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=143 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Segment Parameters</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">After you
have created a segment, you can edit various parameters from the
<B>Segment Parameters</B> box to the left: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-parameters.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Every segment can have a unique label and color. In this example,
I've chosen the most obvious color to use for this French horn part,
but colors are entirely user-configurable, and these defaults are
only suggestions. I'll explain how to configure custom colors later
on, in the Studio chapter.</P>
<H3>Repeats</H3>
<P>Every segment can be made to repeat. It will keep repeating until
the end of the document, or until another segment is encountered in
the track; whichever comes first. These are displayed between repeat
signs ( |: :| ) in the notation editor.</P>
<P>You can turn all repeats into copies at once with <B>Segments -&gt;
Turn Repeats into Copies</B>, or you can turn individual repeats into
copies by double clicking on the light colored repeat rectangles.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/segment-repeats-copies.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>Segment Quantizer</H3>
<P>Changing the setting in this box will immediately quantize all
notes in this segment to the selected grid position. It will move the
start times forward or back to align them with the next closest beat
at the desired resolution. It will not change note durations in any
way.</P>
<H3>Transposing Instruments</H3>
<P>If you wish to write notation for transposing instruments, you can
dial a transposition setting into the <B>Transpose</B> box. This will
cause the part to sound in a different range from written. A typical
Bb trumpet part, for example, should have -2 here. I'll cover this
subject in more depth later on, in the Notation chapter.</P>
<H3>Delay</H3>
<P>The <B>Delay</B> setting allows you to knock the timing of a
segment out of sync on purpose. This can be useful in various ways,
and it's especially amusing for transforming a nicely performed MIDI
file into a simulation of a middle school band concert.</P>
<H2>Getting Around in the Composition</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you've been following along thus
far, you don't actually have anything useful to play. This is
nevertheless the perfect spot to introduce you to the tools you'll
need to use to move around in the composition.</P>
<H3>The Playback Pointer</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
Notice that there's a vertical blue bar running vertically across the
segment canvas. That bar is the playback pointer, and as it sweeps
across the canvas, you'll hear the events as it passes over them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/playback-pointer.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=199 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
While you can't grab it and move it around directly, you can position
it any arbitrary point in the composition by clicking along the dark
gray portion of the ruler at the top, or you can use the transport to
move it around. If you don't see it, play with the transport or the
ruler until you coax it out of hiding.</P>
<H3>The Transport</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
You should have a separate, floating Transport window like this one.
If it's not visible, then toggle it on with <B>Settings -&gt; Show
Transport</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/transport.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=121 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Most of
these should be self-explanatory. If you can't figure out what any of
the buttons do, hover over them a bit, and context-sensitive help
will pop up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">Of
special note are the panic, metronome, and solo buttons. If they're
missing, toggle the extra controls.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
The panic button transmits a &quot;notes off&quot; message on every
channel. It does not transmit an &quot;all notes off&quot; or a
&quot;system reset&quot; or what have you, but litereally transmits a
notes off on every channel on every device Rosegarden knows about. It
can take quite a long time for all the events to transmit, which you
can see happening by watching the &quot;OUT&quot; area in the
Transport, but it's guaranteed to shut up that droning C# and then
some.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The metronome does what you'd probably expect. You can turn the
metronome on during normal playback, as well as recording, and it is
a useful tool to use when practicing playing along with your
composition. Configure it via <B>Composition -&gt; Studio -&gt;
Manage Metronome</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-weight: medium">
The solo button forces the Transport to play only whatever track is
currently selected at the moment, independent of its mute state. (To
&quot;solo&quot; more than one part, you'll need to set the mute for
tracks individually, or by using <B>Tracks -&gt; Mute All Tracks</B>
and then un-muting the parts you desire.)</P>
<H2>Time and Tempo</H2>
<P>As I mentioned, the time signature and tempo are global to the
entire composition. I'll discuss another way to manipulate these in
<A HREF="chapter-7.html">Chapter 7</A>, but here and now you can
manipulate both time signature and tempo to your heart's content from
the main window.</P>
<P>The tempo ruler changes color to indicate changes in tempo. When a
change occurs, the tempo is displayed along the top half of the
ruler, and the time signature is displayed across the bottom. If you
double click this ruler, the Tempo and Time Signature editor will
appear.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/time-tempo-editor.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=228 BORDER=0></P>
<H3>New Tempo</H3>
<P>To add a new tempo, click the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-icon.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>
icon, and you'll be presented with a dialog like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-add.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>By default, new events you add here will be inserted at
the point in time where you clicked to open the Tempo and Time
Signature editor. You can change this by adjusting the &quot;Time of
tempo change&quot; parameters, if you wish.</P>
<H3>New Time Signature</H3>
<P>Use the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-time-icon.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0>
icon, and you'll be presented with a dialog like:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/tempo-time-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=282 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can display the time signature as cut or common
time, and make the time signature hidden. You should probably always
leave &quot;Correct the durations of the following measures&quot;
checked unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. 
</P>
<H2>Autosave</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
I'll conclude this section by mentioning a very useful feature that
doesn't quite fit in anywhere else. As always, &quot;save early, save
often&quot; is the mantra of computer users everywhere, and can't be
stressed enough. It's never a bad idea to take time out to save your
work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
However, Rosegarden attempts to save you from yourself.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
If the GUI crashes for some reason, or you have a power outage or the
like, the next time you start Rosegarden and attempt to load the file
you were working on, you'll be presented with the option of loading
the autosave file instead. If you hadn't yet saved the file, you'll
find it in your ~/autosave directory with a basic name of &quot;untitled.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
The autosave interval defaults to 60 seconds. Configure it via the
Settings menu.</P>

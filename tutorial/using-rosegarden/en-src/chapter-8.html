<H1>Mastering (under construction)</H1>
<P>This chapter will eventually deal with the vagaries of putting
audio and MIDI streams together and mixing them down into a finished
.wav file.</P>
<P>I don't expect to get to this until last. In the meantime, I offer
the following quick and dirty information:</P>
<P>You can master in one of two ways. One is to set up a dedicated
mastering track and play everything while having Rosegarden record
itself. You can use Rosegarden's internal MIDI and audio mixers to
help make this job easier.</P>
<P>The more flexible way is to route Rosegarden's JACK outputs into
something else, like JAMin or Ardour. JAMin looks like a promising
tool here, but I haven't really explored it.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Anyway, all in due time I'm afraid.</P>

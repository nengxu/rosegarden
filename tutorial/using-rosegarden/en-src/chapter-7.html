(needs final edit)</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">So far, we've only looked at
the main window, and have not really edited anything. Rosegarden
provides three different editors, each with its own unique view of
the data. You can view the raw Rosegarden events with the Event List
Editor, you can work with a piano roll metaphor with the Matrix
Editor, or you can see your data as notation with the Notation
Editor. Each of these editors works on a segment level, so you must
have at least one segment selected in order to open one. If you wish
to start with an editor from scratch, you must first create an empty
segment with the pencil tool, as I described in chapter 2, and then
select it.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Event List Editor</H2>
<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">The event list editor is for
editing the composition at the event level. This is the most raw of
the three edit views, and the most difficult editor to use.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Events and Properties</H3>
<P>Rosegarden is not a pure MIDI sequencer, and it does not store raw
MIDI events; instead, it uses its own internal format, which is both
more powerful and more flexible. There are many kinds of events in
Rosegarden. As you would expect, MIDI notes, controllers and the like
are events, but so are hairpins, dynamics, performance directions,
clefs and key signatures, etc. Each class of event has its own set of
unique properties.</P>
<P>Here are just a few examples of types of events with a few their
properties. All of these can be edited from here in the event list
editor, although you probably will find little occasion to tear an
event apart and rearrange its insides.</P>

the moment, let us begin with the simplest of the three. Pick a

icon.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Example Uses</H3>
<P>I have elected to demonstrate only those uses which I judge are
most difficult for you to figure out on your own. While I am only
covering a select few types of events, the process for creating (or
changing) all of them is similar.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inserting a Mid-Composition Program Change</H4>
<P>One thing that can only be done from the event editor is the
insertion of a mid-track program change. This might be useful, for
example, if you wish to switch a string part from playing normally to
playing pizzicato and back without having to write the parts on
different tracks to assign them to different instruments.</P>
<P>In version 1.0 of Rosegarden, the facility for entering program
changes is rather crude and unwieldy. It may see improvement in
future versions, but for the moment, the only mechanism provided is
the entry of program changes by number. There is no facility for
changing the bank anywhere except at the instrument level, so any
program changes you insert directly into segments will be done within
the same bank the track's instrument uses.</P>
<P>If you want to change a &quot;strings&quot; instrument to play
using a &quot;pizzicato&quot; program at a particular point...</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Determine the Insertion Point</H5>
<P>The easiest thing to do is move the playback pointer to the
desired insertion point. In this example, I've done it using the
transport in beat:bar mode to ensure I'm in exactly the desired spot
to insert a program change at bar 2, beat 1, tick 0.</P>
<P>Remember that the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/transport-switch-modes.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=25 BORDER=0>
button changes display modes on the transport.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-add-program-change-set-insert-point.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=183 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Open the Editor, Create an Event</H5>
<P>If you right click on this segment and choose to open it in the
event list view, your cursor should already be at the right spot to
insert a program change at the desired time. In this sample, there
happens to already be a note at that particular time, but that will
not prevent you from inserting a program change event here at the
same time. In fact, if you are inserting a program change into
otherwise empty space, you will have to set its time manually.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-add-program-change-open-editor.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=296 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Click on the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-new-event.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0>
icon to insert a new event. The dialog will open out to a default
event type of &quot;note.&quot; You want to dial &quot;programchange&quot;
into the &quot;Event type&quot; combo box to make this event into a
program change.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-new-event-dialog.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Create the Program Change</H5>
<P>Now you should have a dialog like this. Except, of course, I have
already twiddled the settings in this particular example.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/event-list-new-program.png" NAME="Graphic32" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=239 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now you need to dial in the program change by number.
Unlike the numbers used elsewhere in Rosegarden (which appear out
beside the name when changing programs in the <B>Instrument
Parameters</B> box, for example), these are zero-based, rather than
one-based. If the program &quot;Acoustic Grand Piano&quot; shows up
as program 1 in your studio, you'll have to subtract one from that
and use 0. I've included a zero-based list of General MIDI program
numbers in <A HREF="../chapter-100.html">Appendix C</A> for your
convenience. In this case, &quot;Pizzicato&quot; is program number
45.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Changing an Event Time</H5>
<P>You may have some occasion to change the time of the event.</P>
<P>Click on the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/dot-dot-dot-button.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0>
button out beside &quot;Absolute time&quot; and you will be presented
with a dialog that allows you to re-assert the fact that you want
this event at 2:1:0. You'll need to dial in the Measure (2) beat (1)
and 64ths (0) to get the event to come in at the desire time. If this
does become necessary, at least you already know what time to aim
for, having used the playback pointer and transport to get the
&quot;address&quot; of this particular moment in time.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Managing System Exclusive Data</H4>
<P>I don't have time to do a proper job of discussing this rather
involved and arcane subject at the moment, and I may remove this
before publishing the final draft of this book. In the meantime, here
is a message from Pedro Lopez Cabanillas, author of most of these
features, on the subject of sysex in Rosegarden:</P>
<P>&gt; Would you mind giving me a rundown?</P>
<P>About your question: System Exclusive messages can be recorded,
played, exported to Standard MIDI Files and imported from them as any
other MIDI event. It's not worth to mention that, IMO, as that's what
everybody expects from a MIDI sequencer. But you know that was a hard
way to reach this place.</P>
<P>You need to use the Event List editor for any editing on System
Exclusive events.</P>
<P>To create a new SysEx event from scratch:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>insert Event (star button, or menu Edit-&gt;insert event)</P>
	<LI><P>select &quot;systemexclusive&quot; in the event type combo.</P>
</OL>
<P>3. fill the &quot;Data&quot; field, write some Hex values starting
with &quot;F0&quot; and ending with &quot;F7&quot;. Alternatively,
you can use the &quot;Load Data&quot; button to import the payload
from a &quot;SYX&quot; file.</P>
<P>The load function only imports the first sysex block from the
file, if there is more than one. SYX Files created with Cakewalk can
be loaded into RG.</P>
<P>Use the &quot;Save Data&quot; button to store the payload of an
existing SysEx event into an external &quot;SYX&quot; file.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Matrix Editor</H2>
<P>The Matrix editor is based around the familiar piano roll metaphor
you have probably seen in other packages. It is useful for taking a
hands on approach to tweaking notes where their performance is more
important than their visual appearance as notation. I find myself
using the Matrix most often for two main purposes. It's my preferred
method of sequencing percussion parts, and I use it to knock notes
out of precise alignment on purpose; for example, when sequencing
rolled chords in order to make a MIDI guitar sound more credible.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Special Considerations of Performance vs. Display</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">It is important to note that Rosegarden
is not purely a MIDI sequencer, and at no time can you ever directly
edit raw MIDI events. It stores events using an internal meta format
that includes quite a bit of information about each note.
Rosegarden's events do of course cover the fundamentals of pitch,
velocity and duration, but they also include such attributes as stem
direction, beam state, accidental state, ties, slurs, slashes,
accents and so forth. Of special note, every Rosegarden event
maintains independent duration values for performance and display.
This makes it possible to create a composition that looks good
printed on paper, and yet preserves all of the slight human
imperfections that give a performance its character.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In version 1.0, the Matrix can only
edit <B>performance</B> attributes. This can create interesting
challenges both for performance and notation. If you are working on a
human performance, and you draw notes to their full length here in
the Matrix, you may damage the character of the performance slightly.
On the other hand, if you draw slightly long or short notes here, or
knock the timing off the grid lines intentionally, you will create
ugly notation in the process. In either case, you can make
adjustments to massage away these differences from the Notation
Editor, as I will explain in the next chapter.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">One particularly
noteworthy side effect of the way Rosegarden stores events is that
tied notes are a series of discrete dashes here on the Matrix. It is
really not possible to determine whether a series of notes at the
same pitch will sound as one note or several without looking at the
affected area from the Notation Editor.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Overview</H3>
<P>Let's start with an empty segment one measure long, and I'll show
you the basics. Draw your segment, select it, and then right click on
it and choose &quot;Open in Matrix Editor&quot; from the resulting
context menu. You'll see something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-overview.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=477 HEIGHT=371 BORDER=0></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Local Cursor</H2>
<P>I will go into more detail about the local cursor in the notation
chapter, but it does have its uses here in the matrix as well. If you
take a second look at the rulers, you should see that the one toward
the top of the screen has a magenta cast. This ruler is for
controlling the local cursor, which is a magenta version of the
playback pointer. You can set it in the same fashion you set the
playback pointer, and the two cursors function independently of each
other. The local cursor's main function here in the matrix seems to
be to set the destination location for paste operations.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-two-cursors.png" NAME="Graphic51" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=272 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Entering New Notes</H3>
<P>Now let's do a little one bar loop for demonstration purposes.
Just like on the main view, the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_4c452e31.png" NAME="Graphic65" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor is used to create something new from scratch. In this case, of
course, we're entering a note. Let's pepper this thing with a few
well placed random pitches:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-new-notes.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You may have noticed that those came out as quarter
notes. In order to control the default length of new notes, you must
change the grid setting. Let's enter eight 8<SUP>th</SUP> notes.
First dial in the 8<SUP>th</SUP> note on the grid button:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-dial-grid.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now new notes you enter will take this duration by
default:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-8th-notes.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=141 BORDER=0></P>
<P>It's obviously a bit tedious, but you can enter an entire
composition this way if you desire.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Adjusting Existing Notes</H3>
<P>You can move notes around with the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=29 BORDER=0>
cursor.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-move-notes.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can resize notes with the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0>
cursor, by clicking on a note and dragging it.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-resize-notes.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=142 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>By default, resize operations snap to grid lines. If
you wish to drag the note to some arbitrary length, do so by holding
the shift key while dragging the note.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arbitrary-resize.png" NAME="Graphic12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=113 BORDER=0></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Selecting and Acting on Multiple Notes</H3>
<P>All of these operations can be performed on more than one note at
a time. In order to do so, you need to make a selection. You can use
the 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arrow-cursor.png" NAME="Graphic13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27 BORDER=0>
cursor to select individual notes one by one while holding down the
shift key.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-individual-notes.png" NAME="Graphic14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you wish to select a broad range of notes, you can
select every note of a given pitch by selecting the arrow cursor and
shift clicking on the individual notes on the piano keyboard. Each
click will select every note of the desired pitch, and you can select
any number of pitches in this fashion.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-select-pitch.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=203 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is also possible to select a band or several bands
of notes by sweeping the arrow cursor across the keys while holding
shift.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-sweep-selection.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Finally, you can use the selection event filter to cull
events from your selection. Start by making a broad selection, and
then click on the filter icon to summon my dialog. You can then dial
in various criteria for the notes you wish to remain selected after
the filter is applied.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-event-filter.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=254 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>(The event selection filter is an example of how
different developers on Open Source projects have different ideas how
things should work, and they implement parallel ways of accomplishing
the same thing. I put a considerable amount of effort into developing
the event selection filter, but once I discovered the ways to make
selections using the matrix keyboard, I never actually use the fruit
of my own labor. I don't even feel like it's important enough to
bother documenting its use in detail. Ironic, isn't it? At least I
can laugh at myself.)</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Velocity</H3>
<P>Velocity is a MIDI parameter that describes how hard a note was
hit on the keyboard or other device. It allows for finer expression
of volume than what can be accomplished merely by adjusting the
volume parameter for the MIDI channel. If you have a velocity
sensitive keyboard, this parameter will be recorded as you play.
Under certain other circumstances, you may end up with events that
have no velocity property at all, or a default velocity of 100.
Regardless of how it did (or didn't) get there, it's a simple matter
to tweak it to suit your needs.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Showing the Velocity Ruler</H4>
<P>If the events you're editing have velocity properties, you can
edit them with the Velocity Ruler. If it's not visible, turn it on
from the View menu with <B>View -&gt; Show Velocity Property Ruler</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, all the events have a
velocity of 100, and they show up as orange bars on the ruler.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-default-velocity-ruler.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=214 HEIGHT=266 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">They can be changed by
dragging them up and down, and the bars change colors to reflect
their value. Here I've arranged them so that you can see each bar.
Notice that the notes on the Matrix itself change to reflect these
same colors.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-arranged-velocity.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>NOTE: It can indeed be
somewhat tricky to know which note you're adjusting if there are
several notes of the same duration at the same time. I truthfully
have no idea if there is some trick to this to make managing the
process more foolproof. If anyone knows, email me, and I will mention
in the next edition.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">What If There's No Velocity Property?</H4>
<P>Sometimes note events are created without velocity properties. In
that case, there will be nothing to see or do on the Velocity Ruler
until you add some velocities. You'll need to select a range of notes
and then use <B>Adjust -&gt; Velocity -&gt; Set Event Velocities</B>
to create some. This presents you with a dialog box that offers you
several different options for how to set these up. The Value ranges
from 0, which is the softest possible key strike, to 127, which is
the most forceful.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-adjust-velocities.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=381 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</H4>
<H3 CLASS="western">Controllers</H3>
<P>It's possible to transmit controllers from here in the matrix with
the various Control Rulers. Let's add a Modulation ruler. Choose <B>View
-&gt; Add Event Ruler -&gt; Modulation Controller</B> and you should
now have a new tab at the bottom of your Matrix.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=121 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you right click on the
ruler you can insert a controller event, or even an entire line of
them.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-mod-ruler-line.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=84 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">In this example, I have
elected to insert a line of controllers. It's impossible to capture X
cursors, and I'm far too lazy to try to draw that little pointing
finger, so I will instead describe what I did. After making the
selection from the menu, the cursor changed to a pointing finger. I
picked a start point with this finger, and continued to hold the
button down while dragging the resulting line up and to the right.
After I released the button, it produced this line of controllers:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-line-of-mods.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">You can move individual
controllers up and down, or you can select and move them in groups.
It's rather less obvious than selections elsewhere, but if you look
closely, you can see that selected controller bars are each outlined
in red.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-selected-controllers.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=139 HEIGHT=75 BORDER=0></P>

documenting how I created a segment four bars long, opened it in the
matrix, and could only edit three bars. Can you spot the reason why
that happened? Hint: that ain't four bars long. :)</I></FONT></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Route the Track to a Percussion Instrument</H4>
<P>In order to hear drums, you need to route this track to a
percussion instrument from the main window. If you have General
MIDI-compliant equipment, all that should be necessary is to route
this track to the instrument #10 belonging to a suitable device.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-route-sb-live.png" NAME="Graphic45" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=152 BORDER=0></P>
<P>In this particular example, I want to use the TR-808 drum kit
that's part of the soundfont I'm using on my Sound Blaster Live!, so
I need to dial up bank 1 0 (where the extra drums are) and set the
program to &quot;TR 808.&quot; (Notice that I do not have the <B>[x]
Percussion</B> box checked. That's because I'm not using a GS device
that has drum kits in the same 0 0 bank as the General MIDI programs.
Instead, this device has the alternate drum kits in bank 1 0.)</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Set the Grid and Loop Points</H4>
<P>Now that the track is routed to play using suitable sounds, head
back to the matrix window. It's probably a good idea to pick a finer
resolution than the standard quarter note for the matrix grid. For
this part, 16<SUP>th</SUP> notes were convenient, so I dialed 1/16<SUP>th</SUP>
into the <B>Grid</B> combo box.</P>

<P>To make it easier to get the pattern right, set the first bar to
loop using the ruler on the bottom. (Notice that the ruler on top has
a purplish cast. It's for controlling the local cursor, which I will
discuss in the notation chapter. The ruler at the bottom is for
setting loops, and moving the blue playback pointer.)</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Sequence the Pattern</H4>
<P>The rest is trial and error. Set the main transport window to loop
mode 
<IMG SRC="../pixmaps/transport-loop.png" NAME="Graphic49" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=46 HEIGHT=36 BORDER=0>
and hit play. Use the edit tools to insert, remove, and move notes
until you get a pattern you like. Rosegarden provides no facility for
labeling which keys play which drums, so you may need to putter
around a bit before you figure out where they are. This example uses
a bass, a snare, and a couple of hi-hats, and I have completed my
pattern in this snapshot.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Copy the Pattern</H4>
<P>Select all the event and paste them three times. Use the top ruler
to set the local cursor to the destination for each paste operation.
You should wind up with something like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-after-copies.png" NAME="Graphic52" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=157 BORDER=0></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Finish with a Fill</H4>
<P>Now set only the last bar to loop, then adjust the pattern to make
a little fill.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../pixmaps/matrix-fill.png" NAME="Graphic53" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=109 HEIGHT=196 BORDER=0></P>
<P><I>TIP: I found it a trifle fiddly using copy and paste to make
these copies. I didn't get the placement of the local cursor quite
right, and I had to quantize the results. The next time I had to do
this, I started with a segment one bar long, looped it, then when the
time came to copy it three times, I marked it as repeating in the
<B>Segment Parameters</B> box, then double clicked on three of the
copies, selected all four segments, and used <B>Segments -&gt; Splint
and Join -&gt; Join</B> to join them back into one; then I finished
by un-checking repeat for the segment. It's a toss-up whether method
B is faster, but it's definitely more precise.</I></P>

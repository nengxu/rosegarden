<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to
record with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most
obvious thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record
button to record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If
audio is your aim, you'll want to set your mixer recording source and
get to work. On the other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of
a paraplegic chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in
step recording.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">I will cover step recording later on.
For now my focus is on recording operations that can be performed
from the main window.</P>

<P STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">If you route the track to a
MIDI device, (including the &quot;Synth plugin&quot; device, if
available), then the track will become a MIDI track, and it can only
be used to play MIDI segments. If you drag an audio segment onto this
track by mistake, the audio will not play. Conversely, if you route a
track to the &quot;JACK Audio&quot; device, it will become an audio
track, and it will not play any MIDI segments you happen to drag here
by mistake.

Introduction</H1>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="1_1"></A>What is
Rosegarden?</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Rosegarden-4, hereafter referred to as simply Rosegarden, is a
versatile, open source music creation tool. It combines aspects of a
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) sequencer, an audio
sequencer, and a notation editor into one convenient, powerful, easy
to use package that provides users with a consistent and intuitive
interface.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Rosegarden makes use of two powerful and flexible subsystems
available to Linux. For MIDI operations, Rosegarden employs the <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</A>
(Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) MIDI sequencer infrastructure for
routing in-coming and out-going MIDI events. It can record from any
number of inputs simultaneously, and out-going events can be routed
to any of myriad MIDI clients.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
For audio recording and playback, Rosegarden is one of numerous
applications that make use of the Jack Audio Connection Kit, or <A HREF="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/">JACK</A>,
a low-latency sound server designed from the ground up to meet the
demands of professional musicians. Hand in hand with JACK, Rosegarden
can apply <A HREF="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</A> (Linux Audio
Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugins to audio streams on the fly,
providing effects ranging from EQ to reverb and virtually everything
in between. These plugins can be layered on top of each other for yet
more possibilities.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Bridging the gap between these two technologies, Rosegarden is the
first MIDI sequencer to employ the new <A HREF="http://dssi.sourceforge.net/">DSSI</A>
(Disposable Soft Synth Interface) plugin architecture. MIDI events
are routed through ALSA into DSSI synth plugins, and audio produced
by these plugins can in turn be routed through LADSPA plugins and
thence to JACK.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
Rosegarden provides three distinct ways of viewing, editing, and
entering MIDI events, including a powerful notation editor that
provides many advanced features not typically found in the notation
facility of MIDI sequencers. Underneath these three editors,
Rosegarden provides a segment-based mechanism for arranging blocks of
MIDI and audio data on a canvas that brings the potential of a
layer-based image editing program to the realm of music.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
All of this flexibility means you can use Rosegarden as the center of
a very powerful home studio and music composition solution for Linux.</P>
<H2 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">About This Guide</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
This guide is part manual, part tutorial. I attempt to showcase
Rosegarden's most significant features, and give you suggestions for
how to use these features in order to achieve your musical goals.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
This guide is generally arranged to be read from cover to cover, and
to proceed through Rosegarden's feature set window by window in a
logical way. If you wish to home straight in on a specific topic, the
table of contents is thorough, and the web version is fully
hyperlinked.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Each chapter is loosely divided into two parts. The first half
details the mechanical side of making use of various controls in
order to manipulate data in some way. The latter half focuses on
demonstrating how to use these controls to achieve common musical
goals.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
Menu options and references to some dialog pages or tabs are
formatted in bold, with arrows indicating the progression through the
layers of menus. For example, if I say to use <B>File -&gt; Import -&gt;
Import MIDI File</B> this means to begin at the &quot;File&quot;
menu, find &quot;Import&quot; on this menu and hover on it until the
submenu opens out, then click on &quot;Import MIDI File.&quot;</P>

System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
This document describes Rosegarden-4, the latest in this venerable
line of applications. Some distributions still carry the older
Rosegarden 2, last updated in 1997. Rosegarden-4 is a completely
modern KDE application, and version 1.0 was released in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
The new Rosegarden is a native KDE application that can run on any
system that has the KDE and QT libraries installed, and currently
requires a minimum of KDE/QT 3.1 in order to run. Rosegarden depends
on a number of libraries and architectural features that are
currently only found in Linux. A few brave individuals are interested
in porting it to FreeBSD and OS-X, but at this time no one has been
successful, and Rosegarden remains, effectively, an application only
for Linux.</P>
<H3>Linux Version</H3>
<P>The more recent your distribution, the better. Rosegarden and many
related, interdependent applications are all very new. We at
Rosegarden suggest that you run the very latest release version of
the distribution of your choice, at a minimum. We further suggest
that a distribution with special emphasis on Linux audio, such as
<A HREF="http://www.agnula.org/">AGNULA</A> or <A HREF="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/introduction.html">Planet
CCRMA</A> might well be worth your consideration if you find yourself
having trouble getting all of these things to cooperate. Linux audio
is a bit of an arcane and complex area at the present, and these
special distributions seek to remove much of the sting. I've attained
acceptable, if not ideal results using off the shelf Debian Sarge on
a fast computer, but this is more due to my stubbornness than any
matter of practicality. I heartily recommend that you make use of the
Planet or AGNULA.</P>
<H3>Equipment and Software Required</H3>
<P>Many people are running Rosegarden successfully on older, slower
hardware. However, your CPU can't be too fast, and you can't have too
much RAM or hard disk space. The more resources your computer can
bring to the table, the more you will be able to do successfully with
Rosegarden. The following is a quick list of basic requirements you
will need to satisfy in order to be able to do different kinds of
work with Rosegarden.</P>

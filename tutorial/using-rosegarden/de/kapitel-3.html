<H1><A NAME="3">3 Recording</A></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now that you've configured your Studio,
 you're probably eager to create some segments that contain something
 interesting. In this chapter, I discuss different ways of recording
 live performances with Rosegarden. My focus for the moment still lies
 with manipulating data on the main window.</P>
<H2><A NAME="3_1">3.1 Three Ways to Record</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are three different ways to record
 with Rosegarden. If you come from a MIDI background, the most obvious
 thing to do is plug in your MIDI keyboard and hit the record button to
 record a MIDI segment in the currently-selected track. If audio is your
 aim, you'll want to plug something into an input port on your
 soundcard, set your mixer recording source and get to work. On the
 other hand, if you have all the keyboard skill of a paraplegic
 chipmunk, like I do, you might be more interested in the step recording
 feature described in chapter 7.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3_1_1">3.1.1 Connecting a Track</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Before you record, you might need to
 assign and output device to the selected track. If you're recording
 MIDI, then any MIDI device will do. Rosegarden cannot yet handle
 multiple, concurrent MIDI inputs, so the input you wish to use for
 recording should already have been connected while you were setting up
 your Studio. (See<A HREF="http://chapter-3.html/"> Chapter 3</A> for
 more details.) If you're recording audio, you'll need to tell
 Rosegarden that the currently selected track should contain audio
 segments. Do this by directing its connection to one of the Jack
 channels.</P>

 You should be presented with a series of nested menus that allow you to
 choose the MIDI (or Jack) device and channel for the track.</P>

<H3 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><A NAME="3_1_2">3.1.2 What Do
 Those Black Boxes Mean?</A></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">While it's
 not immediately relevant to our discussion of recording, this is a
 convenient place to talk about the odd little boxes you might have
 noticed in the menus above.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">The column
 of small boxes to the left of the channel provide a concise way of
 showing information about the status of these connections. In the
 examples above, you might have noticed that they were in several
 different states. That's because I have connections configured in my
 Studio for devices that aren't currently available, because the
 associated softsynths aren't running, and because some of my external
 MIDI, and some of my Jack channels weren't assigned to anything. (See<A HREF="http://chapter-7.html/">
 Chapter 7</A> for more information about running softsynths in
 conjunction with Rosegarden.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-style: normal">
 These boxes convey the following information:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="15" NAME="Graphic38" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_72a37f4e.png"
WIDTH="14"> This instrument or device isn't very useful to you right
 now. It is is<B> not in use</B> by a track, and it is<B> not connected</B>
 to any active output path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="12" NAME="Graphic79" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_3dc467bd.png"
WIDTH="15"> This instrument or device could provide a valid output path,
 and all you need to do from here is attach it to a track and begin
 making use of it. It<B> is connected</B> to an active output path, but
 it is<B> not being used</B> by any track.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="15" NAME="Graphic81" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_1e7e4e7a.png"
WIDTH="14"> A track or tracks are connected to this device, but this is
 not currently a valid output path, and the events on any tracks that
 are connected don't have anywhere to go. This instrument or device is<B>
 in use</B> by a track, but is<B> not connected</B> to an active output
 path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" HEIGHT="16" NAME="Graphic80" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_e634bf.png"
WIDTH="14"> This instrument or device provides a valid output path, and
 that path is in use by at least one track. It<B> has a valid connection</B>
 to an output path, and that connection is<B> in use</B> by a track.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 In addition, the instrument in use by the current track will have an
 extra black outline around either a black filled or black outlined box,
 depending on whether or not the path is connected to a valid output:</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="18" NAME="Graphic82" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_500c240c.png"
WIDTH="18"> The active track is connected to an output that is<B> also
 connected</B>. If you play this track, you can expect the device you've
 hooked up to make some noise.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; border: none; padding: 0in">
 <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="18" NAME="Graphic83" SRC="../pixmaps/using-rosegarden_html_5204c333.png"
WIDTH="18"> The active track is connected to an output that is<B> not
 connected</B>. This track, on the other hand, won't make any noise
 until you assign a different device to it or turn on the device that
 isn't currently working.</P>
<H2><A NAME="3_2">3.2 Recording MIDI</A></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now that your track is assigned...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Out of time. You hit the record button.
 You get one measure of count-in, then a red segment starts to appear.
 If you set it up right, you got stuff in there. If not, you got a lot
 of empty nothing.</P>

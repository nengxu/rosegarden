    <h3>Development and installation work</h3>

    <p>A strength of software licensed under the GNU General Public License &ndash; such as Rosegarden and many other Linux audio applications &ndash; is the freedom for anyone to alter it to fit particular needs, without risking the support contract or invalidating the license.</p>

    <p>This freedom is particularly valuable for situations such as education or larger installations where no off-the-shelf package is likely to meet your needs perfectly, unless by also including an expensive set of extra features you don't want.
    </p>

    <p>Fervent Software can offer the skills of core Rosegarden developers to do custom work with Rosegarden and any other GNU licensed music software.  <a href="http://www.ferventsoftware.com/">Contact us for more information.</a></p>

    <h3>Do you offer development work?</h3>

    <p>Anyone anywhere can legally offer services based on Rosegarden and any other GPL software.  If you do and you'd like your name here, just <a href="mailto:cannam@all-day-breakfast.com">contact us</a>.</p>

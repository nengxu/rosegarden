    <h2>Documents</h2>

      <p>Rosegarden comes with some documentation in the form of a
      help system and tooltip help, and you may find the following <a
      href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/">offerings</a> helpful
  as well.</p>

      <h3>MIDI Device Program Maps</h3>
      
    <p>

    For those of you looking to create voice mappings for your own
    MIDI hardware, here is a <a href="rgd-HOWTO.shtml">mini-HOWTO for
    creating voice definitions for Rosegarden-4</a>.  You should also
    check out the ever-growing <a
    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/gui/library/">device
    library</a> (a snapshot of which is included with each
    Rosegarden-4 release) to make sure your device hasn't already been
    mapped.

      <h3>Translation</h3>
      
    <p>

    <h3>Developer Documentation for Rosegarden-4</h3>

    <p>
    Automatically generated class hierarchies and extracted code
    notes can be found on our

    consult <a href="http://www.linuxmusician.com/index.php?option=displaypage&Itemid=51&op=page">the Linux Musician Guide to Home Recording</a>.  It's a bit Windows-centric still but it has some useful
    information for beginners to the world of home recording.

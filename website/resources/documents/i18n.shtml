<div class="oddcontent"><a name="toc1"></a><h3>1. &nbsp;For Users</h3>

<p>A list of supported languages is available at our website.  Russian is
 fairly complete, and German, Spanish, and French are in progress. (We also
 still have a bit of bickering to do about British vs. American to insure
 the best possible user experience on both sides of the pond.)
 Please make your wishes known on the mailing list if
 you can translate musical or technical terminology, or need a
 translated version of RG.
</p>
<p>After you confirm that we support your language, the following three
 steps will get you started with Rosegarden in your native language:
</p><ol>
<li>Install Rosegarden.  If you have KDE running in your language
   already, that's all you need.  Otherwise, you also need to make sure
   kdebase, kde-i18n-&lt;languageCode&gt;, locales, and locales-&lt;languageCode&gt;
   are installed.

</li><P><li>Set your locale to the language you require. For Mandrake/KDE
   users, this is accomplished with KDE menu/Control
   Center/Personalization/Country&amp;Language.  Otherwise this can be done
   manually in your favorite shell by setting the environment variable
   KDE_LANG to your language/locale code of choice.  Example: In the
   Bash shell, type "export KDE_LANG=fr" (no quotes) to use RG in the
   French language.

</li><P><li>Start Rosegarden.
</ol>
<p>It's that easy!
</p>
<p>Problems with the translations or contributions should be sent to
 rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net .
</p>
</div><div class="evencontent"><a name="toc2"></a><h3>2. &nbsp;For Translators</h3>

<p>Open your language file and start translating!  The KDE project has a
 tool called KBabel which helps manage translated strings, but any text
 editor that supports UTF-8 is fine.  It is also rumored that the iconv
 tool is usable for converting to UTF-8 from whatever your editor
 supports.
</p>
<p>When you are ready to submit your translations, send new files or CVS
 diffs to the mailing list.  We encourage you to release early and
 often.
</p>
<p>If no translation yet exists for your language, make a copy of the
 file po/rosegarden.pot.  Name the copied file languageCode.po, where
 languageCode is the ISO locale code for your language.
</p>
<p>For example, the code for Russian is "ru" (no quotes), so the Russian
 translation should be found in ru.po.  A locale-specific example is
 en_GB.po, which is British English.
</p>
<p>The rosegarden.pot file is available from CVS, or on the web at
 <A HREF="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/">http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/</A>.
</p>
<p>Discussion regarding translations is handled for the moment on
 rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, although a translation-only
 list may be opened if there is enough traffic.
</p>
</div><div class="oddcontent"><a name="toc3"></a><h3>3. &nbsp;For Developers</h3>

<p>A few quick notes:
</p>
<p>Please note that the base/ directory does not use QString, and so
 cannot be translated with the KDE tools.  If you think a string needs
 to be there that absolutely must be translated, the mailing list is
 the best place to work this out.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, someone has made the decision that American English be
 the default language for KDE apps, so all internal strings should
 originate in American English.  (I believe setting one's environment
 to en_US is a no-op? Please correct me if I'm wrong- it may just be
 the case that my default environment of en_US doesn't allow any en_US
 po translations.)
</p>
<p>Finally, after adding a new language, don't forget to re-run make -f
 Makefile.cvs and configure to let the Makefiles know about it.
</p>
</div><div class="evencontent"><a name="toc4"></a><h4>3.1. &nbsp;Writing code</h4>

<p>The only thing you really need to know is to wrap all strings that
 need to be translated with the i18n() function, for example,
 i18n("Open File").
</p>
<p>However, please read the following- it will save work in the long run.
</p><ul>
<li>There is a version of the i18n method with two arguments.  The
   first arg is an explanation of exactly what the second arg is used
   for, which helps translators understand ambiguous cases.  (Only the
   second arg is translated.) For example, "View" in English may be
   used as a verb or noun, which are translated differently in
   different languages.

</li><P><li>All languages do not have the same rules about word order.  Using
   the Qstring::arg() method allows easy re-ordering for translation
   purposes.

<p>  BAD: msg = i18n("Loading file ") + filename

<p>  GOOD: msg = i18n("Loading file %1").arg(filename)

<p>  PROBABLY WON'T WORK AT ALL: msg = i18n("Loading " + filename + " for import")

</li><P><li>arg() should also be used for non-translated strings (proper
   names, etc) or frequently-changing strings such as version numbers.
</ul>

</div><div class="oddcontent"><a name="toc5"></a><h4>3.2. &nbsp;Maintaining the translation files</h4>

<p>Every once in a while, the main rosegarden.pot file should be updated
 from the latest source files with the command
</p><pre>
  $ ./scripts/update_i18n_messages
</pre>
<p>(This moves the Qt moc files out of the way and then runs "make -f
 admin/Makefile.common package-messages".  You will need to make sure
 you have KDEDIR set correctly before running it.)
</p>
<p>Similarly, language files can be "merged" to include new diffs using
</p><pre>
  $ make -f admin/Makefile.common package-merge POFILES=po/*.po PACKAGE=po/rosegarden
</pre>
<p>If the changes are large or it has been a long time since the last
 update, announce on the mailing list to get the legions involved in
 updating all translated files.
</p>
<p>Note: The above "make" commands require the file kde.pot to be in
 $KDEDIR/include/kde.pot, so if you get an error use "locate kde.pot"
 to find it and then set KDEDIR appropriately.
</p>
</div><div class="evencontent"><a name="toc6"></a><h4>3.3. &nbsp;Overview of KDE translation system</h4>

<p>The above "make" commands find all of the i18n strings in the codebase
 and put them in the reference file po/rosegarden.pot.  One .pot file
 is created per executable, so there's also one for the sequencer,
 which is not used at the moment- if we ever decide to translate that
 as well, we'll need to manage the po/ directory a bit differently
 because the language files will crash into each other.
</p>
<p>This file should be checked in occasionally, along with the merged
 translated language files.
</p>
<p>At runtime, the system looks in the
 $KDEDIR/share/locale/$KDE_LANG/LC_MESSAGES/rosegarden.mo file for
 strings that match the arguments to i18n and replaces them with the
 translated versions if available.  See the developer.kde.org link
 above for repercussions with respect to translating #defines, etc.

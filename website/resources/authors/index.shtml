    <h2>Origin of a Legend</h2> <p>Chris Cannam and Andy Green began Rosegarden in 1993
    while working together at the University of Bath under the tutelage of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fitch_(computer_scientist)">John
    ffitch</a>, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound">Csound</a>
    fame. Andy was responsible for the MIDI sequencer, and Chris the notation
    editor.</p>

    <p>Rosegarden was originally written for the SGI&reg; IRIX&reg; platform.
    Richard Bown got involved in late 1995, and began work on a port to Linux.
    Richard took over responsibility for working on the Linux sequencer
    engine, which was written using the OSS/Voxware drivers.  Not long after,
    Guillaume Laurent showed up with a big patch of code and a lot of
    enthusiasm.  Rosegarden (the version now known as &quot;X11 Rosegarden&quot;
    began moving along quite quickly from there.</p>

    <p>After a few years, the project started to show its age.  Its dated user
    interface and a lack of internal organization meant that a rewrite was
    inevitable at some point.  After a few false starts, Guillaume got the project restarted,
    and designed most of the GUI using KDE and Qt.  Guillaume kept the project
    spurred on with his admonition on June 2001 that &quot;If we lose focus again,
    [Rosegarden] is dead.  It has already been brought back from limbo a couple
    of times, there won't be a next one.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Thus encouraged, the current incarnation of Rosegarden clawed its way out
    of limbo.  Chris worked on notation again, and Richard continued working on the
    sequencer, eventually adding support for audio playback through <a
    href="http://jackaudio.org">JACK</a>.  The first public alpha release was in
    October of 2001.  Ron Kuris, the first outside contributor, came in with
    some cleanups that nobody can quite remember, and Randall Farmer provided
    some chord labelling code. Then Hans Kieserman stepped in with the idea of
    writing an engine to export Rosegarden's internal music notation to <a
    href="http://lilypong.org">LilyPond</a>, and he began work on
    internationalization.</p>

    <p>In 2002, D. Michael McIntyre became a member of the project when Chris
    addressed his complaints about MIDI applications on the Linux Audio Users
    list, suggesting that most of Michael's problems were due to a lack of
    documentation.  Chris <a
    href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/12/0058.html">suggested</a>
    &quot;What might be more handy would be a tutorial from someone other than
    the developers....&quot;  Thus what eventually became <a
    href="/tutorials/">Rosegarden Companion</a> was born with about 600 lines of
    HTML and 36 images.  Michael had never written a tutorial before, and had no
    idea what he was doing.  Some would argue that he still doesn't, but that
    hasn't stopped him yet.</p>

    <p>Guillaume added Michael as a developer so that he could continue to work
    on his <a href="/tutorials/">tutorial</a>.  He began as a documentation
    writer, and eventually outlasted everyone except Chris to become the
    project's most outspoken and visible personality, and the longest running
    contributor who didn't have some tie to the original X11 Rosegarden.  Pedro
    Lopez-Cabanillas came along right after Michael, and and began to help and
    contribute actively, bringing about countless improvements to MIDI handling,
    in particular, though he has been involved in many different aspects of the
    application, including putting together two build systems, help with the
    translation framework, and pioneering the entire concept of track
    parameters.</p>
    
    <p>Together these five, along with a long list of contributors,
    carried Rosegarden through to a 1.0 release in 2005.</p>
    
    <p>Shortly thereafter, Heikki Junes showed up out of the clear blue sky, and
    demanded developer access.  He went on to transform the LilyPond export code
    from something useful but quirky to something that just works most of the
    time, and he continued the trend of sorting out the final few details the
    rest of us missed.  Finally, French translator Yves Guillemot revealed that
    he had been hiding his programming skills all along, and began to embark on
    increasingly ambitious projects, beginning with the notation editor track
    headers feature, and continuing right along to be surprisingly and quietly
    effective over the years.</p>

    <p>Many people have come and gone in the years since the project's humble
    beginnings, and together the Rosegarden development team have brought the
    application from a fun bit of schoolwork all the way to the world-class
    application before you today.</p>

    <p>Rosegarden currently stands at version 1.7.3, with the new Qt4-based
    Rosegarden &quot;Thorn&quot; slated for release at some point in 2009, if
    possible.</p>


    <h2>Current Project Managers</h2>
    <p>Rosegarden is currently managed by Chris Cannam, D. Michael McIntyre,
    and Heikki Junes.</p>

    <h4><a href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/cannam/">Chris
    Cannam</a></h4>

    <p><img style="float:right; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px;" src="pics/cannam.png" alt=" "/>Chris has been working on one incarnation or another of
    Rosegarden since the end of 1993.</p>

    <p>Chris has worked on nearly every aspect of Rosegarden at some
    point, having been responsible for most of the notation rendering
    and editing, some of the file and data representation, and much of
    the audio and MIDI sequencing, recording, plugin, and MIDI studio
    management subsystems.  He lives in London.</p>

    "/>Michael lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, in the United States of
    America.  He has been doing computer music since the TRS-80 Color
    Computer.  He currently handles most of the project's administrative tasks,
    and a little bit of pretty well everything else, but the hardcore
    programmings jobs he leaves to people who actually have a formal education
    in software engineering, or at least the people who didn't flunk math class.</p>
    <p>Michael has been through a string of layoffs recenty, and is currently
    working as an &quot;Automotive Service Specialist&quot; for a major
    international retailer.  Michael is <b>very</b> broke these days.</p>


    <!--  I hate to pull Pedro's blurb, but maybe it's time.  He's been on
    sabbatical forever, and I guess unless he contributes something to Thorn, we
    probably need to leave him with all the other bygone figures of history.

    <h4>Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas</h4>

    Pedro lives in Barcelona, Spain. He tried Rosegarden the first time a few
    days  after the <a
	href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/11/0317.html">infamous
	post</a> from Michael. He soon felt that the project was  <a
	href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/12/0413.html">worthy of his
	interest,</a> and started to actively help and contribute, bringing
	about countless improvements to MIDI handling, creating the new track
	parameters, and getting involved with bits of this and that almost
	everywhere in the application.  Pedro works as a professional developer
	for a transnational company, and in his spare time contributes to
	several libre software projects, such as <a
	href="http://kmetronome.sourceforge.net">KMetronome</a> and <a
	href="http://kmetronome.sourceforge.net/kmidimon/">KMidimon.</a>  He is
	also an amateur musician, playing pop and classical music with flutes,
	and some MIDI instruments.</p>  -->

    Heikki is a graduate student at the <a
    href="http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/Heikki_Junes"> Low Temperature Laboratory</a>
    at the Helsinki University of Technology in Helsinki, Finland, where he is
    currently working with helium crystals.</p>
    <p>Heikki just showed up out of nowhere one day and asked for developer
    access.  He has gone on to make dramatic improvements in the LilyPond export
    engine, and is almost single-handedly responsible for how useful and
    reliable it has become as a vehicle for producing high-quality printouts.
    He has done a lot of work on the <a
    href="/wiki/">Rosegarden Wiki</a>, and has
    become quite the organizer.</p>

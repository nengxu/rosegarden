    <h2>Authors</h2> <p>Rosegarden has had three core developers who
    between them are to blame for most of the application as you find
    it now, plus a crack team of distinguished, long-term contributors who
    have been doing assorted jobs around here for years.
    </p>
    <p>There have been a handful of interviews with Rosegarden developers published over the years:

    alt=" "/>Chris has been working on one incarnation or
    another of Rosegarden since the end of 1993.  It was then a
    university project for two students, devised by professor <a
    href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/">John Fitch</a> at the
    University of Bath, with <a
    href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/space/">Andy Green</a>
    working on the MIDI sequencer and Chris on the notation editor.
    They were the sole developers until late in 1995.</p>

    <p>Chris has worked on nearly every aspect of Rosegarden at some
    point, having been responsible for most of the notation rendering
    and editing, some of the file and data representation, and much of
    the audio and MIDI sequencing, recording, plugin, and MIDI studio
    management subsystems.  He has mostly managed to avoid working on
    the segment and matrix editors.  He lives in London.</p>

    began  working on Rosegarden at the end of 1995, when he was drafted in to
    take over the Unix sequencer.  He was responsible for the Rosegarden MIDI,
    audio, sequencing and recording code, and significant parts of the GUI.
    He retired from the project after seeing it through to the release of 1.0.</p>

    alt=" "/>Guillaume lives in Cannes, in the South of France.
    He's been using Linux since 1995, and first worked on
    Rosegarden in the summer of 1996, when he supplied a few hundred
    lines of new code in his first couple of emails.  Guillaume is
    responsible for getting the Rosegarden project restarted, for
    creating the basic design and writing much of the GUI code and
    file and data framework, and for most of the project administration.

    <p>He has also helped maintain <a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtk--</a> for a while, and was
    involved in some parts of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> here and there.  In his spare time,
    he works as a software engineer.

    <h4><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~documentarian">D. Michael McIntyre</a></h4>

    src="http://home.comcast.net/~documentarian/michael-headshot.jpg" alt="
    "/>Michael lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, in the United States of
    America.  He got his first taste of Linux toward the end of 2001.  He came
    to work at Rosegarden in December 2002, after being shamed into doing
    something more useful than complaining, as a consequence of his <a
	href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/11/0317.html">infamous
	posting</a> on the Linux Audio Users mailing list.  That discussion
    lead him to begin writing a <a
	href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/">tutorial</a> for
    Rosegarden, which grew into a full-fledged book, and went on to be
    pronounced a &quot;total financial disaster&quot; by the publisher.</p>
    <p>In the years since the book, Michael has concentrated on user support,
    administration, and working toward making Rosegarden a more and more serious
    choice for music notation.  He enjoys <a
    href="http://flickr.com/photos/arborvitian">photography</a>, <a
    href="http://home.comcast.net/~documentarian">woodworking</a>, hiking in the
    mountain country of the eastern US, gardening, cooking, and, of course
    music.  He plays trumpet, alto/tenor horn, flute, recorder, guitar, and some
    keyboard, harmonica, and drums. In his spare time, he drives an 18-wheeler
    to earn the money he pours down all of these various black holes.</p>

    Pedro lives in Barcelona, Spain. He tried Rosegarden the first time a few
    days  after the <a
	href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/11/0317.html">infamous
	post</a> from Michael. He soon felt that the project was  <a
	href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/12/0413.html">worthy of his
	interest,</a> and started to actively help and contribute, bringing
	about countless improvements to MIDI handling, creating the new track
	parameters, and getting involved with bits of this and that almost
	everywhere in the application.  Pedro works as a professional developer
	for a transnational company, and in his spare time contributes to
	several libre software projects, such as <a
	href="http://kmetronome.sourceforge.net">KMetronome</a> and <a
	href="http://kmetronome.sourceforge.net/kmidimon/">KMidimon.</a>  He is
	also an amateur musician, playing pop and classical music with flutes,
	and some MIDI instruments.</p>

    alt=" " />

    Heikki is a graduate student at the <a
    href="http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/Heikki_Junes"> Low Temperature Laboratory</a>
    at the Helsinki University of Technology in Helsinki, Finland, where he is
    currently working with helium crystals.</p>
    <p>Heikki just showed up out of nowhere one day and asked for developer
    access.  He has gone on to make dramatic improvements in the LilyPond export
    engine, and is almost single-handedly responsible for how useful and
    reliable it has become as a vehicle for producing high-quality printouts.
    He has done a lot of work on the <a
    href="http://rosegarden.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Rosegarden Wiki</a>, and has
    become quite the organizer.</p>

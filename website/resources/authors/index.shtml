    <h2>Authors</h2> <p>Rosegarden has three core developers who
    between them are to blame for most of the application as you find
    it now, plus one long-term adjunct developer and writer.  Their
    email addresses are shown below in obfuscated form - change the
    "at" to "@" and the "dot" to "." to form the valid addresses.

    alt="Chris Cannam"/>Chris has been working on one incarnation or
    another of Rosegarden since the end of 1993.  It was then a
    university project for two students, devised by professor <a
    href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/">John Fitch</a> at the
    University of Bath, with <a
    href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/space/">Andy Green</a>
    working on the MIDI sequencer and Chris on the notation editor.
    They were the sole developers until late in 1995.</p>

    <p>Chris has worked on nearly every aspect of Rosegarden at some
    point, having been responsible for most of the notation rendering
    and editing, some of the file and data representation, and much of
    the audio and MIDI sequencing, recording, plugin, and MIDI studio
    management subsystems.  He has mostly managed to avoid working on
    the segment and matrix editors.  He lives in London.</p>

    1995, when he was drafted in to take over the Unix sequencer.  He has been
    responsible for the Rosegarden MIDI, audio, sequencing and
    recording code, and significant parts of the GUI.</p>

    <p>Richard is available to talk to about commercial and
    non-commercial activities involving music technology (including
    Rosegarden) and also to give demos.  </p>

    alt=" "/>Guillaume lives in Cannes, in the South of France.
    He's been using Linux since 1995, and first worked on
    Rosegarden in the summer of 1996, when he supplied a few hundred
    lines of new code in his first couple of emails.  Guillaume is
    responsible for getting the Rosegarden project restarted, for
    creating the basic design and writing much of the GUI code and
    file and data framework, and for most of the project administration.

    <p>He has also helped maintain <a href="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">Gtk--</a> for a while, and is
    involved in some parts of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> here and there.  In his spare time,
    he works as a software engineer.

	    McIntyre</a>, dmmcintyr at users dot sourceforge dot net</h4>

    alt=" "/>Michael lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, in the United States of
    America.  He got his first taste of Linux toward the end of 2001.  He came to work at Rosegarden in December 2002, after being shamed
    into doing something more useful than complaining, as a consequence of his
    <a href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2002/11/0317.html">infamous
	posting</a> on the Linux Audio Users mailing list.  That discussion
    lead him to begin writing a <a href="http://rosegarden.sourceforge.net/tutorial/">tutorial</a> for Rosegarden, which has since grown into a
    full-fledged <a href="http://bomots.de/vorschau.htm">book</a>.</p>
    <p>In
    addition to his writings, he fancies himself to be the project's finish
    carpenter.  Lacking the skill and experience to erect large pieces of the
    structure, he nevertheless has found plenty to do adding chair rails and
    straightening out the crown moulding.  He has even built a small wall or
    two.  All of this is somewhat surprising, considering that his formal training is
    in foreign languages, and he labours by day, at least for the time being, as an over-the-road truck
    driver.

    <h3>Friends of Rosegarden</h3>
    <p>There is an ever-growing list of people who are helping out
    with coding, documenting, translating and testing who also merit a 
    mention and can be said to be <i>true friends of Rosegarden</i>. 
    For the moment you can keep up to date with who the core contributors 
    are by having a look at the latest <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosegarden/rosegarden/AUTHORS?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">AUTHORS</a> file.

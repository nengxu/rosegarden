======Working with branches======


If you would like to play in developing something new, which may potentially break the software, create a new branch to play with.

=====1 Creating a new branch=====

Create a new branch by copying the trunk. For example, for a branch called my_branch, do the following (as a single one-line command):
<code>
svn copy https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden \
         https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/my_branch
</code>
You can see what branches already exist (so as to get ideas for a new name, perhaps) using
<code>
svn ls https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/
</code>
=====2 Checking out a branch=====

Replace <user> with your sforge username and lilypond_everywhere with the branch you are working.
<code>
svn co my_branch
</code>
=====3 Committing changes to the branch=====

Working with branches is as easy as working with the trunk. Commit the changes from the root directory of the branch.
<code>
cd my_branch
svn commit -m "Text which describes the updates."
</code>
=====4 Merging changes from trunk to the branch=====

If you would like to merge changes since svn version 8115, do
<code>
svn merge -r 8115:HEAD https://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden
</code>
If there are no conflicts, you may continue by committing the changes to the branch.
<code>
svn commit -m "merge from trunk"
</code>
Note that such a committing does not work if you had conflicts, therefore, resolve conflicts before committing changes.

=====5 Resolving conflicts=====

In the case of a conflict, there will be 'C' in the place of the file which contained conflicts.
<code>
C  foo.c
</code>
Such a file will be splitted to several parts.
<code>
foo.c
foo.c.r8115
foo.c.r8119
foo.c.working
</code>
After you have resolved conflicts, remove the extra files and commit the changes.
<code>
rm foo.c.*
svn commit -m "merge from trunk"
</code>
=====6 Merging changes from a branch to trunk=====

Merging from branch to trunk is similar to merging trunk to branch, see **4 Merging changes from trunk to the branch.**



However, when committing the merge from the branch, **make a verbose changelog on the changes**.

=====7 Closing a branch=====

When a branch is finished with, we usually either delete it if it was very short-lived and uninteresting,
<code>
svn rm https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/uninteresting
</code>
or else move it to the branches/obsolete directory on the Subversion server. If in doubt, do the latter:
<code>
svn mv https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/my_branch \
       https://<user>@rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rosegarden/branches/obsolete/
</code>

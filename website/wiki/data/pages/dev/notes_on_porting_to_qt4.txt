=====Work so far=====
[[dev:rg_qt4_task_list|List of current and completed developer tasks for RG Qt4 port]]

=====Structuring the work=====

Four sorts of work here:

  - <del>Preliminary or refactoring work that does not depend on any major Qt4 conversion slog (but that some Qt4 conversion slog may depend on).  For example, making the sequencer a thread rather than a process (if we did that).</del>
  - <del>Major Qt4 conversion slog that can be scripted.  See [[A Programme For Tedium]].</del>
  - Major Qt4 conversion slog that can't be scripted (dull manual tasks).
  - The "rewrite bits" -- work that takes serious thought and depends on already having a Qt4 backbone, such as the notation editor canvas.

We can also reasonably expect to have some developers (particularly occasional contributors or newer arrivals) wanting to commit fixes and small features while the Qt4 work is going on.

Possible structure:

  * Keep the trunk as a relatively stable KDE3 version, and pledge that any work committed to trunk during the upheaval will be ported over to the Qt4 version at some point afterwards and will not be lost.  Trunk may or may not be released as 1.8.
  * Create one branch for each chunk of "preliminary or refactoring work" we attempt.  (An existing, rather limited example is the kiftsgate branch, which aims to simplify the notation view by removing most of the action-related code from it, localising it in actions instead -- though we probably should merge that particular branch back to trunk anyway as it's more or less done.)  One developer for each branch, ripping the code apart with gusto.
  * Create one branch for Qt4 conversion slog.  In it:
    * First, concentrate on automatable conversion.  I initially thought it might be best not to commit any changes to actual code, instead just building up a set of transformations in a script that we can then run once at the end and commit the results of.  I've changed my mind about this; I think instead we should commit as we go, and also keep the script that made the changes up to date so that the current changes could always be reproduced.  See [[A Programme For Tedium]].  The sole aim here is to get the code as close as possible to compiling.  This can take place concurrently with the "preliminary" work that is happening in other branches.
    * Merge preliminary work -- a bottleneck.
    * Then do manual conversion of the remaining dull-o slog changes.  For this we probably ought to assign developers chunks of code to handle each (assuming we can find any developers).
  * Finally, there's no alternative but to apply lots of actual developer thought to the "rewrite bits" individually.

=====Major subjects to consider=====

==== Build system ====

Our CMake build system should continue to work, but will need a lot of updating to handle different header locations and to avoid getting mixed up between Qt3/KDE3 and Qt4/KDE4 headers.  I personally have never had KDE4 headers installed on any of my machines at all yet, so I've no idea where they go or what they look like.

It would be great if someone could take on the task of updating the CMake files so as to build with entirely "v4" instead of "v3" headers, libraries, moc etc -- perhaps in the qt4-mechanised branch so we can test it as we test any mechanical updates.


====Translation====

One of our goals should be that no translator should have to rewrite a single word as a result of this port.

Qt4 has a different translation file format from the one we use (it's a .ts file, and it's XML) with different tools; KDE4 uses an enhanced version of the same format, with updated tools.

==KDE3 to KDE4==

Porting KDE3 -> 4 there are some big changes in i18n.  I don't see any
indication that this would break existing .po files, but it's a lot of work
for us.  i18n is replaced with i18n, i18nc, i18np, i18ncp, and ki18n, and
the .arg() methods are no longer used.  That looks interesting.

[[http://websvn.kde.org/*checkout*/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/KDE4PORTING.html#i18n]]

 Plural call is renamed to i18np and does away with %n placeholder, all being
 numbered instead:
<code cpp>
     i18np("One image in album %2", "%1 images in album %2", n, albumName);
</code>

==KDE3 to Qt4==

As far as switching to QT4, if ts2po and po2ts actually work reliably, they
could serve to convert our existing files to the new format, and convert them
back, in order to allow translators to continue to use their familiar tools
in the familiar way.

//(Alexandre: [I did] a po2ts migration back in Scribus 1.0.x days. It was
fairly easy to do this, but in the end the hierarchy that TS files
usually have (a branch for each dialog) was not recreated, so I had to
run lupdate and then use the Ctrl+1 key combination to manually put
everything in place. I fail to find package that has po2ts for qt4 in
Ubuntu, so I cannot test it again.)//

The process of swapping i18n() for tr() looks like a lot of work in itself
though.  It doesn't look like a simple s/i18n/tr/g job at all.  We may have
difficulties bringing all the i18n stuff up to KDE4 too (although there is a
Perl script to do a partial conversion, which ought to help considerably,)
but the QT4 route definitely seems to involve even more difficulties.  As
near as I can tell, the i18n stuff just works thanks to KDE, and we don't
have to find and load the translation files manually in main.cpp or
elsewhere, or futz with any of the rest of this hands-on stuff QT requires to
make translations work.

Plural handling for Qt4 is described at http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq19-plurals.html -- again, a change from what we've been using, but capable enough.

At a glance, it looks like KBabel can handle the QT stuff, but not vice versa.
The most recent linguist-qt4 I have doesn't know what to do with .po files,
but the most recent KBabel I have does apparently know how to handle .ts
files.

COMMENTS: Either option looks evil, but if we're definitely allowing KDE classes in, I'm (dmm) just more comfortable with the i18n option for no really specific and highly justifiable reason.  tr() just seems comparatively lame.

====DCOP====

KDE4 moves to D-BUS, which is conceptually similar.  But my radical
suggestion here is to drop the sequencer process altogether.  Bring it
into a single process, as a separate thread.

Lose the proxying/forwarding classes from src/sound etc, including the
whole of MappedStudio.cpp (an overengineered set of classes never
really used for their intended purpose).  Replace with a simple set of
container classes.

Keep MappedEvent, and keep the SegmentMmapper etc on both sides,
writing into memory buffers of fixed-layout objects -- the difference
is simply that the memory buffers are not shared or file-backed any
more.

Rename MappedComposition to something less suggestive of an actual
composition, but keep it.

Lose MappedInstrument and MappedDevice.  Make the sequencer use the
main studio classes directly (with mutex as appropriate).

Calling directly from one thread's domain to another is fine for
simple accessors etc, but of course we would still need to schedule
requests for play, stop etc to ensure they're carried out in the
correct thread.

Advantages: Code that stands more chance of being understood by other
programmers.  Opens more possibilities for tighter integration,
e.g. reading and writing tempo maps from the sequencer, or fixing the
problems we have with adding and deleting devices, without ludicrous
amounts of pain.

Disadvantages: More possibilities for threading-related bugs.
Crashing sequencer crashes the GUI too.


====Widget and dialog layouts====

The Qt widget hierarchy and layout classes have changed somewhat for
Qt4.  The standard form has become a bit longer in terms of lines of
code, though each line is simpler.

e.g. we do quite a bit of things like

<code cpp>
   QGroupBox *groupBox = new QGroupBox(1, Horizontal, i18n("Group"), parent);
   QHBox *hbox = new QHBox(groupBox);
   QLabel *label = new QLabel(i18n("Thing:"), hbox);
</code>

The more usual way to write this now would be:

<code cpp>
   QGroupBox *groupBox = new QGroupBox(i18n("Group")); // or tr() or whatever
   QHBoxLayout *layout = new QHBoxLayout;
   groupBox->setLayout(layout);
   QLabel *label = new QLabel(i18n("Thing:"));
   layout->addWidget(label);   
</code>

Also, we use

<code cpp>
  QGridLayout::addMultiCellWidget(w, a, b, c, d, align);
</code>

an awful lot.  This has changed to effectively

<code cpp>
  QGridLayout::addWidget(w, a, c, b - a + 1, d - c + 1, align);
</code>

The old and new APIs are (respectively)

<code cpp>
  QGridLayout::addMultiCellWidget(w, fromrow, torow, fromcol, tocol, align);
  QGridLayout::addWidget(w, fromrow, fromcol, rowspan, colspan, align);
</code>

The new API is better, but it's going to be a tricky one.  It might
just about be scriptable.

Qt4 object constructors no longer have a "name" argument (which used to appear optionally at the end of the constructor arguments in Qt3).  It wasn't very useful even in Qt3 and we probably haven't used it all that much overall, but I bet there are some classes that will be using it disproportionately heavily.

====Canvas areas====

The main segment canvas is a widget, which should be straightforward
to port.

The matrix currently uses QCanvas.  Guillaume embarked on an
experimental revision of this for the Qt4 QGraphicsView (in SVN at
trunk/experiments/matrix4).  This builds into a separate application
with just a matrix in it.  In my opinion it's not all that promising
-- it displays, but operations like rubberbanding are slow and zooming
is buggy.  I personally think it would be better to convert the matrix
to a widget like the segment canvas (only much, much simpler), because
I think there would be payoffs in terms of performance and control
over display that justified the change.

The notation view also uses QCanvas, and it may be better as a
QGraphicsView because the layout model is much more complex than the
matrix.  I think we should embark on the most literal possible
translation from QCanvas and items to QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene and
see where it gets us.


====Printing====

It might not be unreasonable to remove Rosegarden's native printing
altogether -- perhaps this is the moment at which we decide that
Lilypond-only is better.

**Arguments for:**

1) Native printing is a mirror of what's on the screen, and there are dozens
of bitchy layout problems on-screen that go right to the page.  Like the
horrible slurs, top of the list.

2) LilyPond export is damn reliable thanks to Heikki.

3) Native printing makes gigantic graphics, and my printer takes hours to
digest just one page of this stuff.  Native printing is totally useless with
my printer unless I use a different, lower-resolution print driver that also
reduces the quality to crap.  I realize this is just me, not the rest of the
world, but native printing is pure evil to me, and I wouldn't miss it a bit.

**Arguments against:**

1) There are still a few things LilyPond does not export at all.  Pedal marks
(FIXED), ottavas (FIXED), C vs. 4/4 per user preference (FIXED),

2) The whole rosegarden-lilypondview thing is still rather fragile, and we
never have done an adequate job of coming up with some way to make sure users
have the right helper applications in place.

3) One of the reasons I work here is because it used to be (and maybe still is) the case that NoteEdit (now Canorus) could only print with external help, whereas Rosegarden could just print and be done with it.  (Similar feelings about their old dependency on the TSE3 library.)  That impression was formed long ago in a different age when everything worked more poorly than it does now, but I still have a little nostalgia for the idea that we can do our own printing in house.

It's probably a lot more sensible just to ditch it though, and focus attention on the remaining LilyPond edge cases that still allow a user to draw X on the screen but force him to print Y.  (One such that springs to mind is [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1560372&group_id=4932&atid=104932]])

====Help====

Qt4 includes a help module starting in Qt4.4 (http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qthelp.html).  I haven't tried to use it.  I think the help is expected to be represented as a set of HTML files.  I'm a bit suspicious about how far the Qt classes actually get you -- I don't really want to be firing up "Qt Assistant" as a help browser -- we want to either have desktop integration (i.e. use the same help browser as KDE, or even a standard web browser) or have our own built-in help window (which it seems can be done without too much trouble using QTextBrowser).

**An unknown:** What does KDE4 do with help?  Research needed!

I'm no great fan of the KDE3 help window; half the time it doesn't even show up for users.  A less well-specified, but more tightly integrated with the application, help system might be no bad thing.  It does beg more questions about translation support though.

//To which Michael replies...  Translation of the manual isn't much of an issue, because the only language that's up to date in any meaningful way, AFAIK, is English anyway.  It would be interesting to see if we could use this as an opportunity to make it easier for the manual to get translated along the way.  It's currently a gigantic pain in the ass.

As far as that goes, I wouldn't much object to converting the whole thing to HTML or something, and doing away with the Docbook.  Docbook can offer lots of cool things, but we don't really care, and it's off-putting.  We've recently had two different people run away screaming after looking at the source for the manual.//

I totally agree about losing Docbook. (Chris)

And then (Michael) we have the complication of someone having taken it under her wing to face lift the thing, and who has agreed to take it upon herself (Shelagh) to wrestle with the evil Docbook syntax for the furtherment of all humankind and stuff.  If KDE4 uses Docbook still, we might ought to just leave well enough alone. (Shelagh) Hey I don't care what you use for the manual, I'd still be happy to do the documentation whatever evil markup you decide to use.

I should check into this.  I currently have KDE4 installed and runnable, but I'm only looking at the -4 apps from my -3 desktop, rather than actually suffering with the whole experience.  (And many of the apps, if not most, are totally broken in this environment, incidentally.)  (I haven't tried the 4.1 beta yet either.  I think it's 4.1 isn't it?  I'm waiting for it to get out of beta before I mess with it at all.)

I have to say this entire overriding issue is almost enough to send me to Windows or, to Guillaume's great delight, OS-X at this point.  Of course I'm still here because I took a 66% pay cut and I'm having to liquidate my life to try to keep out of bankruptcy court, so on the other hand, beer free software is good software.

=====Breakdown of individual classes=====

The notes here contain discussion about how our uses of these classes
might be ported to "pure" Qt4.  Generally I'm not mentioning porting
to KDE4 except in cases where "pure" Qt4 looks hard to do.

It may be worth aiming at "mostly Qt4 and cutting back our dependency
on KDE a bit", rather than going either "pure Qt4" or "the whole hog
with KDE4".

Note that Trolltech took the very sensible decision to change the
function name or make an incompatible prototype for each function
whose behaviour had significantly changed between Qt3 and 4.  This
means you can easily identify the code you need to work on because it
doesn't compile; there's very little risk of having it compile and
then later discovering that doesn't work.

|Yes|KAboutData|The About box is arguably too KDE-specific for us anyway.  We could easily generate a formatted string from the same data.|
| |KAction, KActionCollection, KActionMenu|Qt4's QAction is comparably powerful, but lacks the XML GUI setup logic that we use, and is not readily converted to from KDE3 KAction code. This may be a point in favour of KDE4.|

| |KColorDialog|Use QColorDialog -- but it isn't great and the KDE4 equivalent is likely to be better|
|Yes|KComboBox|QComboBox|
|Yes|KCommand, KMacroCommand, KNamedCommand|Use our own classes.  These are trivial classes and I have suitable replacements already in SV.|
| |KConfig|QSettings does everything KConfig does, but the API is different, and our use of KConfig is quite tricksy in various places -- this is not likely to be completely scriptable.  If KDE4 has a KConfig that is exactly compatible with KDE3's, that might be the answer; but if it's a bit different, it could even be more difficult to move to than the totally different QSettings (because of the risk of getting it compiling and then finding the subtle bugs later).  **Update:** KConfig does have structural changes, to remove the state from the KConfig object.  It's probably six and two threes which is simpler, then.|
| |KDialog, KDialogBase|QDialog provides much of the same stuff, including intelligent allocation of OK/Cancel etc buttons. The API is significantly different though|
| |KDockMainWindow, KDockWidget|I don't know.  This could be tricky.  I fear porting the main window.|

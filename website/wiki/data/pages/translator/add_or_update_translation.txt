If you plan to update the translation of your language, download the release tarball, or pick it from http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/branches/stable_1_7_2/po/ and just translate the strings. You may get hints of the procedure from the instructions in this page.



=====1. I cannot find the translation strings. Where are they ?=====

The translation strings are in [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/|po/ directory of svn]]. The original file [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/rosegarden.pot|rosegarden.pot]] is in english and the translation files have .po suffix.



=====2. I cannot find a translation to my language and I would like to start a new translation. Where to start ?=====

Firstly, download file [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/rosegarden.pot|rosegarden.pot]]. Secondly, check the two-letter abbreviation to your language from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes|the list of ISO 639-1 codes]]. Thirdly, copy [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/rosegarden.pot|rosegarden.pot]] as your [ISO 639-1 code].po :
<code>
cp rosegarden.pot fi.po
</code>
An another example of a more complete code is en_GB in which 'en' stands for the language code for english and 'GB' for the country code for Great Britain.

=====3. There is already the translation to my language, but it seems very old. May start from that ?=====

Surely, you may start from it, download the file of your [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/|(ISO 639-1 code).po in svn]].



=====4. Are there any tools to handle translations ?=====

Just open your language file and start translating! The KDE project has a tool called [[http://kbabel.kde.org/|kbabel]] and the GNOME project a tool called [[http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/|gtranslator]] which helps manage translated strings, but any text editor that supports UTF-8 is fine.
<code>
kbabel fi.po

gtranslator fi.po
</code>
=====5. I have no idea what does this particular translation string mean. Where could I get some hints of its meaning ?=====

You have several options :

  * Check how the string has been translated in [[http://rosegarden.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rosegarden/trunk/rosegarden/po/|other languages (in svn)]].

  * Open rosegarden and try to understand the translation string in its context.

  * You may leave it untranslated and come back to it later.



=====6. I have finished translating. How could I test the translation ?=====



The following three steps will get you started with Rosegarden in your native language:



  - Install Rosegarden. If you have KDE running in your language already, that's all you need. Otherwise, you also need to make sure kdebase, kde-i18n-<languageCode>, locales, and locales-<languageCode> are installed.

  - Set your locale to the language you require. For KDE users, this is accomplished with KDE menu/Control Center/Personalization/Country&Language. Otherwise this can be done manually in your favorite shell by setting the environment variable KDE_LANG to your language/locale code of choice. Example: In the Bash shell, type "export KDE_LANG=fr" (no quotes) to use RG in the French language.

  - Start Rosegarden.



It's that easy!



Problems with the translations or contributions should be sent to [[mailto:rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net|rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net]] .



=====7. I cannot translate some strings. Why there are not in the translation file ?=====

The basic translations strings like "File" are taken from KDE. Remember to install the language packs corresponding to your language. Example from Ubuntu:
<code>
apt-get install kde-i18n-fi
</code>


=====8. The translation works nicely! Where should I send the translation ?=====

Take your file or a diff or the file against svn, and choose from the following:

  * [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=4932&atid=354932|Submit new feature request]], describe briefly your work and attach the file to the request.

  * Send it to the [[mailto:rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net|rosegarden-devel@lists.sourceforge.net]] list.

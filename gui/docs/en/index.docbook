    Notes on style and terminology for Rosegarden handbook
    ======================================================

     * Aim to be clear, brief and direct, but be informal.

     * Write instructions in the second person.

       Good:     "You can select segments by clicking on
                  them with the arrow tool."

       Bad:      "Segments can be selected by clicking on
                  them with the arrow tool."

       Very bad: "The arrow tool allows the user to select
                  segments by clicking on them."

       If you dislike the first of these because you want to
       make the phrase "the arrow tool" more obvious by placing
       it at the start of the sentence, then perhaps you
       should be using a variablelist instead and making
       "the arrow tool" a list item.

     * It's perfectly permissible to detour to explain why
       something is the way it is, particularly if it might
       not be obvious.

     * It's also entirely permissible to omit advanced stuff
       from the "Using Rosegarden" section and document it
       only in the reference section.  "Using Rosegarden"
       should be about understanding how and why, not about
       knowing every last clever detail.

     * Bear in mind we can link extensively from any part of
       the handbook to any other.  Unfortunately DocBook won't
       allow you to write a link to a target that doesn't
       exist yet, so if you want to link to something that's
       not yet been written, either make a note of the planned
       link in an XML comment, or go and create a stub for the
       bit that hasn't been written yet, or else just write in
       a way that allows for a link to be easily added later
       (we could do an editing phase specially for links).

     * Be strict about using the correct terminology for
       Rosegarden data structures (segment, event, track,
       instrument, composition), but don't capitalise the
       words.  Capitalisation is useful in technical documents
       to make it clear that you're referring to a precise
       concept, but you shouldn't have to do it to make your
       meaning clear in user documentation.  If something
       seems ambiguous without, try rewording it instead.

    <para>
      <application>Rosegarden</application> is a &MIDI; and audio
      sequencer and musical notation editor.  It allows the user to
      record, arrange and compose music.  Music is represented either
      by traditional score or &MIDI; data, or by sets of audio files
      either imported or recorded from a microphone, guitar or
      whatever audio source you care to specify.  Music data can be
      edited to create a composition, effects can be applied and the
      resulting mix can be burnt to CD or turned into MP3/ogg format
      suitable for distribution on the web.  Professional notation
      editing support also provides high quality printed output of the
      composition.

      <sect2 id="segment-view-overview">
	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
	    &rosegarden;'s main layout is similar in concept to many
	    other popular sequencers.  It is based around a track
	    concept &mdash; the main window shows a track editor with
	    a list of tracks and their associated instruments down the
	    left hand side.  You can manipulate and move blocks of
	    music data (referred to as &ldquo;segments&rdquo;) on the
	    track editor as well as opening the segments themselves in
	    specialised editors (<link
	    linkend="notation-view">notation</link>, <link
	    linkend="matrix-view">matrix</link>, and <link
	    linkend="event-view">event list</link>).

	</para>

      <para>
      Tracks can be assigned to a range of &MIDI; or audio instruments.
      In the picture
      above we see two segments (shown as yellowy-green blocks) on the
      track editor, shown on tracks that are assigned to the "IIWU
      Synth" instrument.
      </para>
    </sect2>
      <sect2 id="segment-view-instruments">
	<title>Tracks and instruments</title>
	<para>
	  Each track must have an instrument assigned to it, in order
	  to be heard.  To assign a track to an instrument, click and
	  hold with the left mouse button on the track label: a pop-up
	  menu will appear with a list of all the available
	  instruments in it.
	</para>
	<para>
	  An instrument can be understood as a single channel on a
	  &MIDI; device, or as an audio output.  Tracks containing
	  note data should be assigned to &MIDI; instruments, and
	  those containing audio to audio instruments.  You can assign
	  more than one track to the same instrument, in which case
	  the multiple tracks will use the same sounds.
	</para>
	<para>
	  You can change various properties of the instrument
	  associated with a track using the <link
	  linkend="segment-view-instrumentparameterbox">Instrument
	  Parameter Box</link>.  This is where, for example, you would
	  set a MIDI instrument to use a particular patch and so
	  produce a particular sound (piano, strings etc).
	</para>
	<para>
	  See the
	  <link linkend="studio-introduction">Studio</link> section
	  for more about instruments.
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="segment-view-creating">
	<title>Creating segments</title>
	<para>
	  To create an empty segment, in order to begin composing
	  something new, you need to use the pencil tool.  Click on
	  the pencil on the toolbar, and then click at the point where
	  you want the segment to start (at the correct height for the
	  track you want the segment to be on, and at a distance
	  across the editor window corresponding to the correct time)
	  and drag rightwards until the segment is the right number of
	  bars long.
	</para>

	<para>
	  By default new segments start on a barline and extend bar by
	  bar, but this snap-to-grid effect can be prevented by
	  holding down Shift while clicking and dragging.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Once you have created a segment, you can then begin editing
	  using the <link linkend="matrix-view">matrix</link> or <link
	  linkend="notation-view">notation</link> editors.  To use one
	  of these editors, either double-click on the segment, or
	  else click with the right mouse button and choose the editor
	  you want from the context menu.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If you are intending to record from a MIDI device or audio
	  input, you don't need to create a new segment to record into
	  first -- each separate recording always goes into a new
	  segment, created automatically during recording.
	</para>
	</sect2>

      <sect2 id="segment-view-manipulating">
	<title>Manipulating segments</title>
	<para>
	  The main window contains a selection of "tools" for editing
	  segments.  These are available from the main toolbar: first
	  select the tool you want from the toolbar, and then click
	  and drag on the segments on the main canvas.
	</para>

      <sect3 id="segment-view-selector">
	<title>The Select tool</title>
	<para>
	  The "select tool" (the arrow tool) is actually a
	  multipurpose tool: it can be used to select, move, copy,
	  resize and create segments.</para>

	  <para>The most obvious use is
	  selection: select a single segment by clicking on it with
	  the select tool, or select several by clicking with Shift
	  held down, or by clicking in an empty area of the window and
	  dragging out an area.
	  </para>

	<para>To move segments with the select tool, simply click and
	drag on the segment.  To create copies, click and drag with
	Ctrl held down.  To resize a segment, click and drag on the
	right-hand edge of the segment; and to create new segments,
	click and drag on an empty area with the middle mouse button.
	    </para>

	  <para>
	The select tool doesn't replace the other tools completely,
	though &mdash; sometimes you need to be more precise about
	which operation you intend, particularly when working on small
	segments.
	</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="segment-view-move-resize">
	<title>Move and Resize tools</title>
	<para>To move a segment to a different start time or track,
	use the Move tool and click and drag on the segment you want
	to move.  If you hold down the Ctrl key while dragging, the
	segment will be copied instead of moved.</para>

	<para>To resize a segment, use the Resize tool, and click
	and drag on the right-hand end of the segment.</para>

	<para>For both move
	and resize you can hold Shift to avoid snapping to a
	particular grid position.
	</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="segment-view-split-join">

	    to split a single segment
	    into two separate segments.  To split your segment, select the
	    split tool and click on the segment you wish to split.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    By default segments are split on the closest barline in relation to
	    the cursor, but this can be prevented by holding down Shift while

    <para>
    The segment parameter box allows you to modify some aspects of the
    selected segments.  If a single segment is currently selected, its
    parameters will be shown in the segment parameter box and can be
    edited there.  If several segments are selected, the parameter box
    will only show the current values where they are the same for all
    of the selected segments -- but you can still edit them, and your
    changes will apply to the whole selection.

        The track editor displays a series of segments arranged against

        &rosegarden; sweeps a pointer across
        the tracks from left to right playing the contents of the
        segments as it crosses them.  The pointer's position on the
        screen is tracked and controlled by a dialog called the
        Transport.

      <para>
        The Transport shows the current position of the pointer either
        in terms of absolute time from the first bar (in seconds) or
        in 24-fps <acronym>SMTPE</acronym> time or alternatively in
        bars and beats. It can also show time from the end of
        composition if you should so wish.  These functions are
        controlled by the small buttons on the left of the main
        transport display.
      </para>

      <para>
        The main controls on the transport start the sequencer playing
        and pause it, fast forward the pointer position, rewind it, stop
        it or jump to beginning or end of composition.
      </para>

      <para>
        Additional controls and a &MIDI; event display are hidden on the
        bottom flap on the transport, which can be toggled on or off
        using the arrow button next to it at the left.  Also on this
        extra portion there are buttons for recording, looping,
        soloing and for turning on a metronome.

	<para>For example, imagine a setup consisting of a PC with two
	physical MIDI ports, one of which has an external synth
	attached to it.  Here you would normally configure Rosegarden
	so as to have one MIDI device, corresponding to the synth.
	You could then configure this device with the correct name and
	patch map, and then specify a connection for it that
	corresponded to the relevant MIDI port on your soundcard.
	Each of the 16 default instruments on the device could then be
	configured with a suitable program, and you would then assign
	tracks to those.</para>

	<para>
	  In practice, Rosegarden will by default create a device for
	  each of the available connections on startup.  So in the
	  example above, two MIDI devices will be created by default
	  even though you only need one.  You would generally then
	  rename and apply patch maps to the first, and delete or
	  simply not use the second.  Remember that there is no way
	  for Rosegarden to know what synths you actually have plugged
	  in to the MIDI ports on your computer: for this reason, the
	  devices created at startup are just intended to be a default
	  set, and it's up to you to ensure that the devices you
	  configure match those you are really using.
	</para>

	<para>Once configured, the studio setup is stored with every
	Rosegarden-format file you save.</para>

	<title>Studio mapping on &MIDI; import</title>
	<para>
	  
	  When you import a &MIDI; file into a composition, &rosegarden;
	  uses the existing studio setup to determine how to map the
	  &MIDI; programs onto &rosegarden; instruments.  The aim is to
	  ensure that every &MIDI; program gets mapped to an instrument
	  that really exists in your studio (and thus is actually
	  attached to your computer), so that all the &MIDI; tracks
	  can be heard.

	</para><para>

	  The &MIDI; program-change and bank-select events found in the
	  imported file are used when importing, but only as an aid to
	  help find the appropriate instrument for each &MIDI; track
	  from the set of instruments in your studio.  So, for
	  example, if your studio is currently set up to contain only
	  <acronym>GM</acronym> instruments, and you import a &MIDI; file with <acronym>GS</acronym> program
	  changes onto it, &rosegarden; will remap the <acronym>GS</acronym> banks back
	  onto <acronym>GM</acronym> because they're all it knows that you have at the
	  time you import the file.  It doesn't remember the original
	  <acronym>GS</acronym> program numbers.

	</para><para>

	  This means that you should always ensure that your studio is
	  correctly configured for the devices you actually have,
	  before you import the &MIDI; file.  Otherwise the program data
	  in the &MIDI; file may be lost.

	<para>
	  Remember that each MIDI device contains a number of
	  instruments, and that you can assign tracks to those
	  instruments.  In MIDI terms, each instrument corresponds to
	  a single channel on your MIDI synth.  You can choose which
	  of the available voices (sounds) on your synth each
	  instrument uses, but in order to do this, you need to let
	  Rosegarden know the names for all of the available voices.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This dialog allows you to attach banks of programs (names for
	  voices) to your MIDI devices, thus permitting each
	  instrument on a device to be set to use one of those voices
	  in the <link
	  linkend="segment-view-instrumentparameterbox">Instrument
	  Parameter Box</link>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The usual way to set up the program names for a device is
	  simply to import them from one of the supplied device
	  (".rgd") files.  To do this, select a device in the list on
	  the left of the dialog, then click the Import button below
	  the list and choose the .rgd file corresponding to your
	  synth.
	</para>

        <para>
        If there is no current .rgd file available for your synth,
        then you can use this dialog to create a new bank.  To do this
        you will have to find the program map in your synth's MIDI
        Implementation Chart and enter all the names by hand: you can
        then Export them to a .rgd file to share with other Rosegarden
        users.  Contact the rosegarden-user mailing list if you have
        made a new .rgd file and would like to share it.  (This is how
        all of the existing .rgd files have come to be included with
        Rosegarden: other users have contributed them.)

	  If you happen to be using a soft-synth or soundcard synth
	  that uses SoundFont (.sf2) files, you can simply load the

	  <title>Variations</title>

	  <para>
	    Some MIDI devices (for example, those from Roland)
	    organise their program names using a scheme known as
	    "variations".  For these devices, you generally want to
	    select a program by first selecting the basic program name
	    &mdash; such as a piano &mdash; and then selecting one
	    of a set of variations on that program &mdash; such as an
	    electric piano.  This is in contrast to General MIDI-based
	    synths, which organise their programs into banks and
	    expect you to choose a bank first and then a program from
	    that bank.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Rosegarden can support devices that use variations, but
	    you still have to enter the program names in a bank
	    format.  Internally, devices that use variations still use
	    MIDI bank select controllers to choose between the
	    variations; you need to find out from your synth's
	    documentation whether your device uses the LSB or MSB bank
	    select to choose variations, and which bank number
	    corresponds to which variation.  You can then enter the
	    banks as normal, and use the "Show Variation list based on
	    MSB/LSB" option on the bank dialog to tell Rosegarden to
	    show variations instead of banks when displaying that
	    device in an instrument parameter box.

	<title>Rulers and cursors</title>

	<para>
	  The &rosegarden; Notation editor window includes two rulers
	  and two cursors.  The rulers are the horizontal strips
	  divided up with tickmarks at top and bottom of the main
	  notation canvas, and the cursors are the coloured vertical
	  lines shown initially at the start of the top staff in the
	  editor.  <!-- !!! screenshot -->
	</para>

	<para>
	  The purple cursor is the insert cursor.  It shows the point
	  at which operations such as insert and paste will take
	  place.  You can reposition the insert cursor by clicking or
	  dragging on the top ruler, or by clicking with the Select
	  tool on an empty part of the staff (avoiding any events), or
	  by clicking anywhere with <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> held down.
	</para>

	<para>You can also use the left and right arrow keys to move
	the insert cursor one event at a time.  If you hold <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> while
	pressing the arrow keys, the cursor will move a whole bar at a

	<para>
	  The blue cursor is the playback pointer.  Just like the

	  this shows the location of the current playback or record
	  position.  It can be repositioned using the bottom ruler.

	  Most of the menu and toolbar editing functions in the

	      <para>
		The basic tools are the selection tool, the erase
		tool, and those for inserting notes, rests, text and so
		on, which are usually accessed from the toolbar buttons.
		Choosing a tool changes the default behaviour of the
		mouse buttons on the main notation canvas, at least
		until another tool is chosen instead.  For example,
		choosing the selection tool allows you to make
		selections and so to use the selection-based functions
		(below); choosing an insertion tool (such as one of the
		notes) switches the <acronym>GUI</acronym>'s behaviour so as to insert
		notes by clicking on the canvas; choosing the erase tool
		allows you to remove events by clicking on them.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		You can also change the current tool using the Tools menu.

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The majority of the remaining menu functions require a
		selection to be made on the canvas before they can be
		used. Some of them (such as <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> 
		or the <guimenuitem>Note Style</guimenuitem>
		functions) will operate on any selected events; others
		(such as the <guimenuitem>Grace Notes</guimenuitem> 
		or <guimenuitem>Stem Directions</guimenuitem> functions)
		will refuse to work unless the selection contains 
		some notes.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		To select some events on the canvas, switch to the
		Select (arrow) tool and then outline a rectangular area
		containing the events you want to select. The selected
		events will then be highlighted in blue. If you click
		on a single event, just that event will be selected <footnote> 
		<para> You can also double-click on a single event to open an

	      <para>
		To select a whole bar, double-click with the Select tool
		on some empty space within that bar; to select the whole
		staff, click three times. The Edit menu carries
		functions for selecting extended areas based on the
		location of the insert cursor, and you can also select
		events around the insert cursor by holding Shift and
		pressing the left or right arrow keys.

      want to add the note.</para>

      <para>If you add a note at the same time as an existing note of
      different duration, the editor will generally assume that you
      want to create chords and will split the existing or new note
      accordingly so as to create one or more chords with ties.  If
      you really do want to chord two different durations, you can
      select the tied noteheads and use the Collapse Equal-Pitch Notes
      function to merge them together. Alternatively, the default
      behaviour can be changed in the &rosegarden; configuration dialog
      so as not to do the split at all.</para>

      <para>If you add a note exactly over an existing note of
      different duration (i.e. at the same pitch), the duration of the
      existing note will be changed to that of the new one.</para>

      <para>If you add a rest at the same time as an existing note,

	    <para>The default behaviour of the notation editor is to

	      this can be changed using the <keycap>H</keycap> key, which
	      switches to chord mode so that subsequent insertions occur
	      at the same time as the last one.  Pressing

	    <para>All of the insertion commands are also available on a

	      menus show the keyboard shortcuts and so provide a useful
	      reference in case you forget which key is which.</para>

	    <para>The keyboard shortcuts are currently designed for use
	      with a QWERTY-layout keyboard.  There is not yet any way to

	  <title>Entering notes using a MIDI keyboard</title>

	  <para>
	    You can enter notes into the notation editor one at a time

	    but the durations you have selected in the editor itself.
	    This is known as "step recording".
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    To start entering notes from a MIDI keyboard, first make
	    sure the keyboard is configured as your default MIDI
	    record device.  Then make sure a notation tool is selected
	    to set a duration.  Then press the <!-- !!!  image of
	    button --> step recording button on the notation editor's
	    toolbar, or select Step Recording from the Tools menu.
	    From that point on all notes pressed on the MIDI keyboard
	    will be inserted at the current insertion time in that
	    notation window, until step recording is switched off
	    again or activated in a different window or the window is
	    closed.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    You can select another notation tool while step recording
	    is in progress, in order to insert notes of different
	    durations; and you can also switch into Chord mode <!--

      <sect2 id="nv-signatures">

	<para>The first thing to know about the way &rosegarden; handles
	these is that time-related changes (tempos and time
	signatures) are treated entirely differently from clefs and
	keys. In order to simplify managing playback and recording as
	well as notation, &rosegarden; requires that when the tempo or
	time signature changes, it does so in all staffs at once.  You
	can't have one staff in 3/4 and another in 4/4 simultaneously,
	or one staff playing at 120 to the beat and another at 90.
	This applies only to time: there is no such restriction on the
	use of clef and key changes.</para>

	<para>To change the clef, key, tempo or time signature within
	a notation editor window, position the <link

	  <para>The Lyric editor, available from the <guimenuitem>Open Lyric
	  Editor</guimenuitem> option of the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, allows you to edit all of
	  the lyric events for a single staff at once, using a fairly
	  rudimentary textual editing system.  To use it, just
	  activate the menu option, edit the lyric text in the
	  resulting dialog, and then hit OK.</para>

	  <para>The lyrics you enter should follow a particular
	  format.  Bar lines are vital to avoid the editor getting
	  confused, and are represented with a slash ("/").  Within
	  each bar the individual syllables are separated by spaces
	  (at least one space: the editor doesn't care about any extra
	  whitespace). Each syllable in turn will be attached to the
	  next subsequent note or chord within that bar (although at
	  the moment the editor can get quite confused by chords that
	  are not exact, i.e. that require smoothing or
	  quantizing).</para>

	  <para>If you want a note to have no syllable attached to it,
	  you need to provide a dot (".") as the syllable for that
	  note.  (This is why the default lyric text for a segment is
	  usually full of dots.)  Remember to separate the dots with
	  spaces, so that they are clearly separate syllables.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you want more than one syllable on the same note,
	  with a space between them, use a tilde ("~") instead of the
	  space.  It will be shown as a space on the score.</para>

	  <para>If you want to split a syllable across two notes, with
	  a hyphen, you need to enter a space following the hyphen so
	  the editor knows to treat it as two syllables.  (Hyphens get
	  no special treatment within syllables.)</para>

	  <para>Syllables consisting only of numbers surrounded by
	  square brackets (like "[29]") will be ignored; this is the
	  format used for the automatically-generated bar numbers
	  shown in the editor.</para>

	  <para>You should also be aware that the textual format of
	  lyrics is only used for editing:  the lyrics are actually
	  stored as distinct text events (one per syllable).  This
	  means that the text format may potentially change in the

	  although the event format should not change and so your
	  saved files should continue to be compatible.</para>

      <sect2 id="nv-tuplets">
	<title>Triplets and other tuplets</title>

	<para>A triplet group consists of three notes or chords played
	in the time of two.  (More precisely, it consists of notes
	with a total duration of three arbitrary units played in the
	time of two of those units.)</para>

	<para>We use the word <quote>tuplet</quote> to describe the general
	situation in which notes with a total duration of any given
	number of units are played in the time of a different number
	of those units: nine notes in the time of eight, or six in the
	time of four, or a crotchet and a quaver in the time of a
	single crotchet, or even two notes in the time of three.  (At
	present &rosegarden; does not support the last example &mdash; tuplet
	groups must always be played with a shorter duration than
	written.)</para>

	<para>The triplet and tuplet menu functions work by taking an
	existing series of notes or rests and squashing them so they
	play quicker, filling in the left-over space at the end of the
	series with a final rest and drawing the whole as a tuplet
	group.  You can therefore create a new series of triplets by
	entering the first two notes of the series (in their normal
	form), making them into triplets, and then filling in the rest
	left over by the triplet operation with the final note of the
	triplet.  Or you can apply the triplet operation before you
	enter any notes, thus turning the original rest itself into
	triplet form, and then insert the notes of the triplet on top
	of it.  Some examples may help:</para>

	<!-- Need examples and screenshots -->
	
	<!-- Then discuss general tuplet dialog... -->

	<para>To specify a general tuplet group, we need to know what
	the base note is (for example, if we play three crotchets in
	the time of two then the base is a crotchet) and the ratio of
	the number of base notes written to the number played.</para>

      <!-- Quantization, smoothing, and display of quantized notes -->

      <sect2 id="nv-quantization">
	<title>Notation from performance data</title>

	<para>
	  &rosegarden; is a multi-purpose program: it is a notation
	  editor, but it is primarily a sequencer and editor for
	  performed music.  And in performance, of course, the times
	  and durations of notes are rarely as precise as they are on
	  a printed score.
        </para>

        <para>
          This means that it's often desirable for &rosegarden; to do
          a lot of tidying of the basic note times and durations when
          attempting to make meaningful notes to show in the notation
          editor.  This is a kind of quantization, but a kind that
          requires a surprising amount of guesswork to do well.
          &rosegarden; includes a quantizer designed to do a slightly
          better job of this than the plain grid quantizer.
	</para>

	<para>Applying
          quantization strictly for notation is rather unimaginatively
          referred to as <quote>notation quantization</quote>: it only
          applies to the notes you see and edit in notation, and
          doesn't affect the notes that play, or that you edit in
          other views such as the matrix.  This quantization is
          automatically applied to music imported or recorded from
          MIDI, although not all of its possible capabilities are
          enabled by default.
	</para>

	<para>
	  There are two ways to see which notes have been quantized
	  for notation.  By default, each notation view contains a Raw
	  Note Ruler (in the group of rulers above the score) showing
	  a rectangular block for each note.  This block is positioned
	  so as to represent the time and duration of the note as
	  performed, but with the top and bottom edges of the
	  rectangle extended or shortened to represent the time after
	  notation quantization.  If this is too much information for
	  you, you can alternatively choose (in the configuration
	  dialog) to show in a green colour all note heads in the
	  score that have had their timings altered by notation
	  quantization.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the quantization &rosegarden; has used is not suitable,
	  either for the entire score or for a selection of notes, you
	  can choose to use a different level of quantization or none
	  at all.  To apply a different quantization to some notes,
	  select the notes and use the <link
	  linkend="commands-nv-menu-transforms-quantize">Quantize</link>
	  menu function (tick the box labelled <quote>Quantize for
	  notation only</quote>).  The quantization level or type used
	  by default can be changed in the configuration dialog.

		<term>Complexity</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>The "complexity" of a notation quantizer is its
		    most fundamental parameter.  A "complex" quantizer
		    will be more prepared to accept that complex-looking
		    music is in fact intended to be complex, whereas a
		    "simple" quantizer is more likely to assume that
		    complex-looking music results from an imprecise
		    performance of simple music.
		  </para>
		  <para>The default setting is intended to produce
		    reasonable results for a fairly wide range of music.

		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>Base grid unit</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>The base grid unit (set to a note duration
		    value) specifies the absolute minimum unit of note
		    that will be permitted to remain in the score after
		    quantization.  For example, if set to a semiquaver,
		    all notes will be placed on boundaries of a multiple
		    of a semiquaver, with durations also a multiple of a
		    semiquaver.
		  </para>
		  <para>The setting of the base grid unit is not quite
		    as significant for a notation quantizer as it is for a
		    plain grid quantizer, because all it does is impose an
		    absolute limit on the level of precision permitted by
		    the complexity parameter.  Mostly, when you find a
		    case in which increasing the grid unit produces better
		    results, you've actually found a case in which the
		    quantizer simply didn't do as good a job as it should
		    have been able to with the smaller unit.

		    tuplets, by setting a limit on how many notes per
		    tuplet group it will attempt to identify.  If it is
		    set to <quote>None</quote>, the quantizer will not
		    attempt to identify tuplets at all.

		  This function works slightly differently depending

		  dialog in which you can choose a threshold below
		  which the segment is considered "silent"; it then
		  splits the segment whenever its amplitude falls
		  below this threshold.  For MIDI segments, it simply
		  splits the segment everywhere that a full bar of

		  This function invokes a dialog allowing you to

		  the selected segments in half with all the notes on
		  or above that split point in the "higher" segment
		  and all the notes below it in the "lower".

		</para>
		<para>
		  If the music in the segment consists of two separate
		  parts (e.g. left and right hand piano parts) that
		  are not always completely on either side of a single
		  split point, you may with to select the "ranging
		  split-point" option.  If this is selected,
		  Rosegarden will attempt to track the two parts as
		  they move up and down, usually doing a slightly
		  better job of separating out notes that were
		  intended to lie in the two separate parts.

		</para>

			  Any notes following the clef will keep

			</para>
			<para>
			  For example, inserting a

			  For example, inserting a tenor clef in the

  <chapter id="developers">
    <title>Developer's Guide to Rosegarden</title>

    <sect1 id="developers-note-fonts">
      <title>Configuring custom notation fonts</title>

      <para>If you have a notation font that is not currently
      supported by Rosegarden, you can create your own mapping XML
      file to describe the font's character map and metrics in a way
      Rosegarden can use.  These files are installed in the
      fonts/mappings subdirectory of the Rosegarden installation
      directory, and a number of samples are included with the
      distribution.</para>

      <para>You can also use these mapping files to define new
      pixmap-based fonts, in which every shape in a particular size is
      loaded from a separate pixmap file.  The two standard notation
      fonts supplied with Rosegarden-4 are pixmap fonts defined in
      exactly this way.
      </para>

      <para>It is even possible to define a notation font as using one
      or more scalable system fonts, augmented with pixmaps for
      particular sizes or for characters not found in the scalable
      fonts.  This is because most of the mapping file format is the
      same for scalable and pixmap fonts, and where there are
      different elements for the different sorts of fonts, it is
      usually possible to include both of them.  Rosegarden will
      usually use pixmaps where available and scalable fonts
      otherwise.
      </para>

      <sect2 id="developers-note-fonts-mapping-format">
	<title>Notation font mapping XML format</title>

	<para>Here is a summary of the XML elements that may be used
	in the font mapping file format.</para>

	<sect3 id="developers-note-fonts-mapping-format-font-encoding">
	  <title>rosegarden-font-encoding</title>

	  <para>This element must exist in every mapping file, and
	  should contain all the other elements.  The only attribute
	  is "name", which contains the font's name as shown in the
	  font selection dropdown.  Although the file format will
	  permit any name to be used here, Rosegarden will only pick
	  up the font corectly if the XML file has the same name as
	  the contents of this attribute (except that the XML file
	  should be named in lower-case and should end in ".xml").
	  </para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3 id="developers-note-fonts-mapping-format-font-information">
	  <title>font-information</title>

	  <para>This should normally be the first child element of
	  "rosegarden-font-encoding".  It may have the following
	  attributes:

	    <variablelist>
	      <varlistentry>
		<term>origin</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A textual description of the likely origin of
		  the mapped font (not the origin of the mapping
		  file).</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>copyright</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A textual description of the likely copyright
		  status of the mapped font (not the copyright status
		  of the mapping file).  Note that because the mapping
		  file contains information such as origin and
		  copyright of the font itself, it is usually
		  advisable to make separate mapping files for
		  separate fonts where practical, even if the fonts
		  share other mapping data.</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>mapped-by</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>The name of the creator of the mapping file
		  (i.e. you, presumably).</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>type</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>The type of the font.  This attribute should
		  contain one of the values "pixmap" or "scalable".
		  Fonts that are loaded into the windowing system and
		  are available to Rosegarden as standard system fonts
		  have type "scalable"; fonts that need to be loaded
		  from pixmap files corresponding to individual sizes
		  of pixmap (such as the feta and rg21 fonts included
		  with Rosegarden) have type "pixmap".</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>smooth</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>A boolean attribute indicating whether the
		  font is antialiased (smooth) or not.  Should have
		  the value "true" or "false".  If the font is smooth,
		  other display elements such as beams and slurs that
		  are not generated from the font will also be
		  antialiased.</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term>autocrop</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>Only relevant for scalable (system) fonts.
		  Rosegarden usually expects the metrics for a font to
		  contain the vertically smallest bounding boxes for
		  elements such as note heads and accents, rather than
		  including empty space above or below these elements
		  for alignment purposes.  Most fonts do not do what
		  Rosegarden expects.  Therefore for these fonts you
		  should set the autocrop attribute to "true"; then
		  Rosegarden will crop any unnecessary space from the
		  top and bottom of these elements when rendering
		  them.</para>
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>

	    </variablelist>

	  </para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3 id="developers-note-fonts-mapping-format-font-requirements">
	  <title>font-requirements</title>
	  <para>
	    This element is only relevant for scalable fonts.  It is
	    used to specify that this font should only be offered if
	    certain system fonts are available, as well as to
	    associate IDs with those system fonts to refer to in the
	    "font-symbol-map" element.  This scheme is used to decide
	    which notation fonts should be offered to the user, and
	    also allows you to compose a Rosegarden notation font from
	    more than one system font if desired.
	  </para>
	  <para>The "font-requirements" element should contain a list
	  of "font-requirement" child elements.  Each of these has two
	  attributes: "font-id", containing a numerical ID of your
	  choice for reference elsewhere in the file, and either a
	  "name" or a "names" attribute.  If "name" is provided, it
	  will be used as the name of a single system font to be
	  associated with the font id; if "names" is provided, it will
	  be treated as a comma-separated list of system fonts and the
	  first one found will be associated with the font id.
	  </para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3 id="developers-note-fonts-mapping-format-font-sizes">
	  <title>font-sizes</title>

	  <para>The "font-sizes" element specifies which notation font
	  sizes are available, and how the nominal font size relates
	  to the dimensions of non-font elements such as stems, staff
	  lines and beams.  The "size" of a notation font is assumed
	  to be the distance in pixels between staff lines, or more
	  precisely, the height of a conventional note head that
	  completely fills the space between lines: the size therefore
	  does not include the thickness of either of the neighbouring
	  staff lines.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    There are two possible child elements of "font-sizes":
	    "font-scale" and "font-size".  Their use depends on the
	    type of font being described.</para>

	  <para>
	    For pixmap (non-scalable) fonts, the "font-sizes" element
	    should contain a list of "font-size" elements, one for
	    each size of pixmaps available.  The pixmaps themselves
	    must be installed in the
	    fonts/&lt;font-name&gt;/&lt;font-size&gt; subdirectory of
	    the Rosegarden installation directory, where
	    &lt;font-name&gt; is the name of the font (as specified in
	    the "rosegarden-font-encoding" element at the start of the
	    mapping file), or a lower-case version of the name, and
	    &lt;font-size&gt; is the pixel size of the font.  A font
	    size will only be made available to the user if it has an
	    entry in the "font-sizes" list and the pixmap directory is
	    found.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	    For scalable fonts, the "font-sizes" element should
	    contain one "font-scale" element that defines the
	    relationships between font and non-font elements in a
	    general way, and also defines the relationship between
	    Rosegarden's nominal font size and the size of the
	    corresponding system font.  If this "font-scale" element
	    is found, then Rosegarden will assume the font is
	    available in any size.  You can however still include one
	    or more "font-size" elements to define precise proportions
	    for any particular size for which the general proportions
	    do not quite work correctly, for example because of
	    rounding error.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The attributes of "font-scale" and "font-size" are very
	    similar.  The main difference is that all attributes of
	    "font-scale" are floating-point values relative to the
	    font size, where 1.0 is the base font size (i.e. the
	    distance between staff lines), whereas attributes of
	    "font-size" are integer pixel values.  The attributes
	    available are as follows.  (Those marked "optional" have
	    vaguely sensible defaults, so it's a good idea to try not
	    setting them first.)
	  </para>
	    
	  <variablelist>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>note-height</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This attribute is only available for the
	      "font-size" element, and it is mandatory in that
	      element.  It defines the base size of font to which the
	      other attributes in this element apply, and a size that
	      will be offered to the user and used when looking up
	      pixmaps for this font.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>font-height</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>May be used in either "font-size" or "font-scale".
	      This is only relevant for scalable fonts, but is
	      mandatory for them if used in the "font-scale" element.
	      This defines the size of the system font used to draw a
	      given size of notation font.</para>

	  Unmanaging widgets is the usual method for temporarily

	</para>
	<para>
	  You can unmap a widget, but leave it under geometry
